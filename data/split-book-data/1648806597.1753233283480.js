window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>AD Earth, 2508. Humans have spread across the six arms of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Unified Authority controls Earth's colonies with an iron fist and a powerful military - a military made up almost entirely of clones....</p> <p>Private first-class Wayson Harris was raised in a U.A. orphanage among thousands of clones born and bred as the ultimate soldiers. But Harris isn't like the other Marines: He has a mind of his own. He figures he's paying for that independent streak when his first assignment out of boot camp is the smallest Marine outpost in the whole U.A.</p> <p>When a rogue general surfaces, the remote desert world Harris thought was a dead-end posting becomes anything but. Fighting off the general's raid gains Harris a promotion. But it also brings him to the attention of some unfriendly U.A. leaders. They have their own plans for the military - plans Harris disrupts by his very existence. For in an army of clones, the one unforgivable sin is to be different....</p> <p>Performed by Ken Jackson, Eric Messner, Tim Getman, Richard Rohan, Dylan Lynch, Elliot Dash, Joe Brack, Gary Telles, Thomas Penny, Mort Shelby, Tim Carlin, Nick DePinto, Drew Kopas, Yasmin Tuazon, David Coyne, Danny Gavigan, Thomas Keegan, Christopher Graybill, Jeff Allin, Gregory Gorton, Christopher Scheeren, Terence Aselford, Nanette Savard, James Konicek, James Keegan, Colleen Delany.</p>";
