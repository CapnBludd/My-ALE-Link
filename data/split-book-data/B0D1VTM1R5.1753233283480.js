The all-star cast multi-award-winning cult hit comedy returns, with more surreal goings-on in the lives and loves of the doctors and staff at East Hampton Hospital (warning: contains very little medical content).</p> <p>Green Wing: Resuscitated picks up 12 years after the events of Green Wing, and it's all change at East Hampton Hospital... Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) has become a media personality, adding TV appearances and podcasts to his work as an anesthetist; 'Mac' MacCartney (Julian Rhind-Tutt) has returned from several near-death experiences to pick up as a surgeon, and Caroline Todd (Tamsin Greig) has been making waves in America as a medical pioneer. There have been promotions for both Harriet Schulenberg (Olivia Colman) who is now East Hampton's Head of HR, and Boyce (Oliver Chris), who has been made head of radiology. This doesn't mean that Alan Statham (Mark Heap) has left the hospital - while his killing spree with Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood) lead to her being imprisoned, his lawyers got him off with a spell in psychiatric care, and he has returned to work under Boyce. Not everyone has changed circumstances, though - Sue White (Michelle Gomez) remains as East Hampton's staff liaison officer, and Martin Dear (Karl Theobald) is still not a doctor, despite having been training for the exams since we last saw him…</p> <p>Starring: Oliver Chris as Boyce, Olivia Colman as Harriet, Pippa Haywood as Joanna, Mark Heap as Alan, Michelle Gomez as Sue White, Tamsin Greig as Caroline, Stephen Mangan as Guy, Julian Rhind-Tutt as Mac, and Karl Theobald as Martin.</p> <p>Featuring: Margaret Cabourn-Smith, Lauren Douglin, Simon Kane, Lorelei Mathias, Oriane Messina, Will Sebag-Montefiore, Nimisha Odedra and Paul G.
