window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Before <i>Twilight </i>and <i>True Blood</i>, only one vampire commanded “the children of the night\". In this bloodthirsty tale of unholy terror, Count Dracula slips into Victorian London with a cargo of his native Transylvanian soil - so he can rest between victims.

But to do this, he must uncover the vampire’s lair and pierce his heart with a wooden stake.</p> <p>Recorded in Los Angeles before a live audience at the Skirball Cultural Center in May 2011. </p> <p>Directed by Rosalind Ayres </p> <p>Producing Director: Susan Albert Loewenberg </p> <p>Denise Carole as Tart/Others </p> <p>Sheelagh Cullen as Mrs. Westenra/Others </p> <p>John Glover as Renfield </p> <p>Karl Miller as Jonathan Harker </p> <p>Lisa O'Hare as Mina Murray Harker </p> <p>Moira Quirk as Lucy Westenra </p> <p>David Selby as Abraham Van Helsing </p> <p>André Sogliuzzo as Maxwell/Others </p> <p>Simon Templeman as Count Dracula </p> <p>Nick Toren as Dr. John Seward </p> <p>Matthew Wolf as Arthur Holmwood </p> <p>Recording Engineer/Sound Designer: Mark Holden for The Invisible Studios, West Hollywood </p> <p>Associate Producer: Christina Montaño </p> <p>Sound Effects Artist: Theresa Arrison </p> <p>Stage Manager: Jared Cox </p>";
