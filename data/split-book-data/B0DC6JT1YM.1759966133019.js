window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What would you change if you could start all over again? From Leeanne Slade, the bestselling author of The Rebound and Told You So, and narrated by Daisy Edgar Jones (Normal People) and Sam Claflin (Me Before You), this summer, fall in love with Henry and Grace. </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Five Years Earlier </p> <p></p> <p>Henry Dunne knows three things: that agreeing to host this raucous house party was a terrible idea, that he absolutely cannot show up to his nursing shift tomorrow with a hangover, and that the beautiful redhead in the corner will be sleeping in his bed tonight.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>But what he doesn’t know is that Grace Monroe, the ambitious and fiercely independent chef catering this party, is about to walk a tray of cream cheese appetisers straight into his chest and turn his world upside down. Now, the work-a-holic with a reputation for keeping things casual is planning romantic dates and meeting the family. Utterly smitten, Henry now knows something else: that Grace is the one and that absolutely nothing could come between them. . . </p> <p></p> <p>Present Day</p> <p></p> <p>Grace Monroe is one day away from thirty, her restaurant has just been declared bankrupt, her beloved grandmother has been rushed to hospital, and she’s now sobbing in a packed train station. The only way life could get worse is having Henry Dunne – the man who showed her what true love and heartbreak feels like – see her like this. </p> <p></p> <p>And there he is, wordlessly watching her from the opposite escalator. </p> <p></p> <p>A bottle of wine and an erratic wish later, Grace wakes up to one hell of a life glitch: it’s five years earlier, her twenty-fifth birthday, and she’s got picture-perfect memory of the missing years. Grace’s plan is clear: save her doomed career and prevent the worst heartache she’s ever known. All she needs to do is stop history repeating. . . </p> <p></p> <p>Easy, right?</p>";
