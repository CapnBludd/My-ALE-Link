window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Dragon Ship</i> is a stirring space adventure from master storytellers Sharon Lee and Steve Miller - number 15 in the award-winning Liaden Universe saga. Space ships, action, adventure - all tied together with a strong dollop of romance and intrigue - make this a compelling series for a wide range of readers, from romance to military-SF lovers. </p><p>First Class Courier Pilot Theo Waitley was already known as a nexus of violence - and then she inherited the precarious captaincy of a mysterious self-aware ship designed to serve a long dead trader. Now she has a trade route to run for Clan Korval while she convinces the near-mythic ghost ship <i>Bechimo</i> - and herself - that she wants to commit herself as the human side to their immensely powerful symbiosis. While her former lover battles a nanovirus that's eating him alive, she's challenged to rescue hundreds of stranded pilots and crewmen from an explosive situation in near orbit around a suddenly hostile planet. Lovers, enemies, an ex-roomie, and a jealous spaceship are all in peril as Theo wields power that no one in the universe is sure of - especially her.</p>";
