window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Named one of the best novels of the year by both <i>Locus</i> and <i>Science Fiction Chronicle</i>, Alastair Reynolds's debut <i>Revelation Space</i> redefined the space opera. With <i>Chasm City</i>, Reynolds invites you to reenter the bizarre universe of his imagination as he redefines Hell.</p> <p> The once-utopian Chasm City - a domed human settlement on an otherwise inhospitable planet - has been overrun by a virus known as the Melding Plague, capable of infecting any body, organic or computerized. Now, with the entire city corrupted---from the people to the very buildings they inhabit---only the most wretched sort of existence remains. For security operative Tanner Mirabel, it is the landscape of nightmares through which he searches for a lowlife postmortal killer. But the stakes are raised when his search brings him face to face with a centuries-old atrocity that history would rather forget.</p>";
