window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The people of ancient Sumer are gathered to celebrate the rite of the Sacred Marriage, a joyous and glorious testament to the unity of Goddess and Man. Times are tough, crops are failing, and this year’s ceremony holds special significance.</p> <p>But for the priestess Simi, the fertility rite is very personal. Because it is Simi who will be locked in a room with a stranger to carry out the blessed responsibilities. Only this time, the stranger is no stranger at all....</p> <p><i>In the Lap of the Goddess</i> is written by Arvind Ethan David and Whitney Mosery and stars Jacob Tobia as Simi, Kasper as Eresha, and Utkarsh Ambudkar as King Gilgamesh.</p> <p><i>Earworms</i> is a series of short speculative-fiction dramas–tales of what might have been...or might yet be...or perhaps in fact are, if only you were paying attention...if only you were listening.</p>";
