Ten years and thousands of miles away from the scene of the crime, Bailey is laser-focused on her career. She's a rising star at her TV network, newly promoted as senior producer for the reality show, The Cruise. Things are on the up. And then Eli Murphy applies to be a contestant on The Cruise.</p> <p>It’s taken a lot for Bailey to make something of her life and to heal from her adolescent trauma. She's changed her name and chopped her hair into a severe blonde pixie. But what she really owes her new life to is The Squad, the group of ride-or-die sisters-for-life survivors who have bonded over group therapy and stayed closely linked. They're always ready to assist one of their own in seeking the justice so often denied them.</p> <p>Being stuck incognito on a luxury yacht with Eli might actually provide the opportunity for closure that Bailey has been waiting a decade for. As senior producer, she's in the perfect position to cast him and five members of The Squad as the female contestants on the show. As an all-new season of The Cruise sets sail, Bailey and her secret squad begin their own game for the ultimate prize: revenge.</p> <p>The complete list of narrators includes: Catherine Văn-Davies, Mitchell Bourke, Genevieve Hegney, Lola Bond, Chika Ikogwe, Andrea Solonge, Ayeesha Ash, Chloe Tobin, JR Reyne, Nic English, Cam Ralph, Ben Chapple, Emma Jones, Rowan Witt, Katherine Beck, and Jayden Koulizakis</p>";
