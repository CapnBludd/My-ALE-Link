From his breakout role as Dr. Frank-N-Furter in <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show </i>to his iconic depiction as the sadistic clown Pennywise in <i>It </i>to his critically acclaimed role as the original King Arthur in both the Broadway and West End versions of <i>Spamalot, </i>Curry redefined what it meant to be a “character actor,” portraying heroes and villains alike with complexity, nuance, and a genuine understanding of human darkness. </p> <p>Now, in his memoir, Curry takes listeners behind-the-scenes of his rise to fame from his early beginnings as a military brat to his formative years in boarding school and university, to the moment when he hit the stage for the first time. He goes in-depth about what it was like to work on some of the most emblematic works of the 20th century, constantly switching between a camera and a live audience. He also explores the voicework that defined his later career and provided him with a chance to pivot after surviving a catastrophic stroke in 2012 that nearly took his life. </p> <p>With the upcoming 50th anniversary of <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show </i>and the 40th anniversary of <i>Clue, </i>there’s never been a better time for Tim to share his story with the world.</p>";
