In fact, it's just begun, and Van knows that every decision he's made for the past decade will come to bear on who lives, and who dies—and who is meant to rule over a universe where freedom and justice are the ultimate pursuit.</p> <p>At any cost, Van and his crew will finish the job, but they're going to need a lot of help from people and beings who have been observers.</p> <p>Until now.</p> <p>The time for watching is over. The time for victory is now. But the cost might be more than anyone can pay, and Van is no longer merely an agent of justice. He's a father, a husband, and a friend—and he's going to need every connection in the stars to defeat the ultimate enemy and save his people.</p>";
