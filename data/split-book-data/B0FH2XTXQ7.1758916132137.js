But what happens when it could be a reality?</p> <p><i>The Secret Daughter </i>is the tale of Nikki Carlson, an adoptee whose search for her roots sets her on an unbelievable thrill ride and emotional odyssey that forever changes her. Adopted as a toddler into a big game-hunting Minnesota family and raised on the flat prairies of the Midwest, Nikki’s life is wholly unremarkable. Haunted by the mysteries of her origins, once Nikki comes of age, she begins to search for her biological roots. What she uncovers is more surreal and twisted than anything she could have imagined.</p> <p>Her quest to understand her origins brings her into the world of New York high society and then in an unforeseen turn of events, across the Atlantic and into old Italian aristocracy. She unlocks these pieces of information one painstaking step at a time, with people trying to block her path at every turn.</p> <p>The man believed to be her biological father is an Italian aristocrat, a staple of European gossip columns who hosted Jackie Kennedy in Rome, was rumored to have romanced Princess Margaret, and in his later years, lived a secret second life with his much younger male partner.</p> <p>When Nikki eventually connects with the man she believes is her biological father, things take a tragic turn: he’s just learned he’s terminally ill—which prompts a cast of characters in his life to stake their claims to his roughly €20 million estate.</p> <p>Suspicions simmer around Nikki’s intentions, her timing and her place in the world of her purported father. What follows is a dizzying descent into deception, betrayal and high-society scandal. Throughout, questions swirl: Is Nikki a grieving daughter simply trying to connect with her heritage? Or is she a manipulative outsider exploiting an old man at the end of his life? Did this man want to leave her anything? Who did he want to have his riches and why?</p> <p>There are accusations of fraud, whispers of art theft, and even suggestions that the funeral arrangements are a smokescreen to bar Nikki from the family. Tabloid photographers chase the story. Lawyers line up on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>More than anything, Nikki Carlson wants to know the truth about her origins. She wants answers and to deeply connect to who she really is. Will she unlock her true identity? Will she gain the resolution she’s sought her entire life?</p> <p><i>The Secret Daughter</i> is an unforgettable true saga that urges all of us to ask who we are and what it is we want.</p>";
