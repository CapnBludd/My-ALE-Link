window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Four prophesized heroes must band together to obliterate an evil galactic empire—they're outnumbered by the trillions, but are they outwitted?</b></p> <p>Ariock, a superhuman among men, destroyed the Torth Homeworld. Since then, the massive throng of survivors—refugees, freed slaves, and cave dwellers—have been docked in orbit in an undefended starship, one small war behind them. But when the telepathic Torth, thirty trillion strong, catch a whisper of their location, the greatest of all wars will descend.</p> <p>For the exiles stranded in space, food and water is running out, and as Ariock struggles to regain his power, hope for a safe new world is draining away too—though not for Ariock's great-grandfather Garrett, who heeds the visions of an oracle outlined in a book of prophecies. Centuries ago, the oracle foretold of four titans, each defined by a dominant trait. Now they have finally come together as one.</p> <p>Ariock is Strength, already proved time and again as a messianic force to be reckoned with. Garrett is Will, a legendary being of extraordinary resolve and determination. The ethereal Evenjos, an ever-evolving goddess-empress imprisoned for millenniums by the Torth, is Transformation. And Thomas, the physically fragile but uncannily clever supergenius, is Wisdom.</p> <p>As prophesized, a clear path to victory lies ahead. But there's a wrinkle. One veer from that path, one tiny misstep by any of the four heroes, one minor lapse in trust, and they're doomed to fail. Lest their starship become a floating tomb, they must prepare to work a miracle. And as the Torth amass an armada of battleships at every temporal stream, they're going to need one.</p> <p><b>The fourth volume of the hit sci-fi fantasy series—with more than 750,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
