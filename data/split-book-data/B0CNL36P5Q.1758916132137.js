Now, they work for the Icarus Group, a top-secret government organization hunting for portals created by a long-vanished alien race, portals that can teleport a person hundreds or thousands of light-years in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>Usually, those hunts are long and tedious. But Roarke has now been handed an intriguing offer. A criminal boss, Robertine Cherno, will hand over a hitherto unknown portal to the Icarus Group in exchange for Roarke and Selene agreeing to transport a passenger named Nikki across the Spiral.</p> <p>There’s only one catch. Nikki is a professional, high-priced, highly feared assassin. And she’s on the job.</p> <p>That would have been bad enough. But when the alien Patth also move to gain possession of the portal, bad quickly promises to go to worse.</p> <p>Especially when it becomes clear that Nikki herself is being hunted by someone.</p> <p>It’s up to Roarke and Selene to untangle the mysteries and get to the truth before they become someone’s collateral damage.</p>";
