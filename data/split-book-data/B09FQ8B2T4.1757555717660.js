window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Its Majesty’s Government. Greatest Britain: For a Global Universe.</b></p> <p>Agent Isaac Steele has problems. He spends all his splibs on drink and drugs. He has some deep-seated and very much unresolved issues with his parents. And his robotic partner at Greatest Britain’s Department of Clarification, Dr Timothy Stephens, is ruled more by his heart than his hard drive. </p> <p>But all these issues take a back seat when Isaac stumbles upon a case involving the most sensitive information in the cosmos - a Never File, inaccessible to all except those with the highest clearance. He is expressly forbidden to involve himself. So naturally he does. </p> <p>So begins an investigation that will take him across the Discovered Universe, into the path of the mysterious Forever Man, and eventually to answers about his past. Along the way, he will have to contend with aliens, robots, monsters, bureaucrats and, perhaps most deadly of all, his own numerous flaws. </p> <p>Written and narrated by BAFTA award winner Daniel Rigby (<i>Eric and Ernie</i>, <i>Flowers</i>, <i>Black Mirror</i>), not since T<i>he Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy </i>have listeners been offered such a joyful, anarchic and insightful universe. </p> <p><i>Contains strong language</i></p>";
