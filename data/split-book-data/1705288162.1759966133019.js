But the men and women of their expeditionary forces are trapped behind enemy lines on a besieged planet. Losing those troops will lose the war. Their only hope? A last ditch rescue mission led by Captain Hal Cutter and his battleship, <i>Achilles</i>.</p> <p><i>Titan's Vengeance</i>: The Reach. A vast barren tract of space lying between the besieged stars of the Kingdom of New Avalon and their distant allies. And it is the latest battlefield in the war burning across the void. </p> <p>Admiral Valin Sarven of the Hegemony fleet is as cunning as he is ruthless. A master tactician commanding the most powerful vessel in space, the battleship Behemoth. He is dispatched into the Reach with a single goal: to sever the long, tenuous supply lines linking the Kingdom to the Liberty Federation. </p> <p><i>A Relentless Fury</i>: One after another, the Kingdom's star bases have fallen before the New Hegemony and their coalition. Only one remains in the strategically vital Talos Rift: Valestra.</p>";
