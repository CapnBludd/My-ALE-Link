But things are about to get worse. With Reddy's family and allies held prisoner by the mad General Kurokawa, the mysterious League and evil Dominion plotting schemes of their own, and the Grik trying to build their swarm and concentrate power, Reddy faces danger on all sides.

With the mighty League battleship <i>Savoie</i> at his command, he plots a terrible vengeance against Reddy and his tiny, battered destroyer. The stage is set for a devastating cataclysm, and Reddy and his allies will have to risk everything to protect what they hold dear. </p>";
