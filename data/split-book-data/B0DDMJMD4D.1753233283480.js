window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>With freedom fleeting and human extinction a distinct possibility, the heroes of prophecy must work together to safeguard the future of the galaxy.</b></p> <p>The balance of power is shifting in the vicious galactic war against the Torth Majority. The heroes are led by Ariock, a superhuman titan who wins every battle. The secret behind his victories is Thomas, the telepathic renegade supergenius.</p> <p>But resting on their laurels isn't an option. Overconfidence could be fatal, thanks to the enemy supergenius known as the Death Architect. And there may be an intrinsic threat among their ranks as well. While Ariock is conquering alien cities and protecting Freedomland, Thomas is transforming the captured Torth into zombified slaves. What better way for Thomas—part human, part Torth—to prove he's on the side of the good guys than to neutralize their adversary's minions?</p> <p>He knows it'll take more than lumbering prisoners with space dust for brains to win the ultimate war, however, so he's devising something else. With his superluminal communications technology, all the planets of the galaxy could soon be knitted together in new and frightening ways. One giant hivemind. But are his powers being wielded on behalf of liberty and humanism? Or is Thomas a betrayer helping to galvanize the Torth?</p> <p>Ally or foe? Ariock is having his doubts. Relying on Thomas could be a grave mistake, but a lapse in trust would be just as bad. Either way, if Ariock makes the wrong decision, freedom will be just a blip in the history of the galaxy . . .</p> <p><b>The fifth volume of the hit sci-fi fantasy series—with more than 750,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
