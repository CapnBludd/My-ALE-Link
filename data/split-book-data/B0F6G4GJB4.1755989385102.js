window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Shaky</b> is a sharp, soulful, and surprisingly romantic comedy about Nicole, a 30-year-old drummer whose wild-child lifestyle screeches to a halt after a shocking Young-Onset Parkinson’s diagnosis. Her plan? Keep partying, keep drumming, and pretend nothing’s changed.</p> <p>But when she crashes back into her childhood home—complete with her no-nonsense mom and painfully put-together younger sister—Nicole’s carefully constructed denial starts to unravel. As old tensions flare and new romantic sparks fly, she’s forced to confront the one thing she’s been avoiding: her future.</p> <p>Messy, funny, and full of heart, <i>Shaky</i> is a story about losing control and learning to love anyway—your body, your people, and maybe even that one guy you swore you’d never catch feelings for.</p>";
