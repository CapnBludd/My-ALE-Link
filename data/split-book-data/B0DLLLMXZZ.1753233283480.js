window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Van is proving that with power comes danger.</b></p> <p>From the shores of a secret planet to the halls of power in Washington, Van navigates a complex web of lies, law, and politics, all so that Earth can be saved from the clutches of ruthless criminals.</p> <p>But these people aren't from Earth. In fact, they're not even human, and they see Earth as a ripe fruit ready to be picked.</p> <p>That doesn't work for Van and his crew, so he begins fighting back with the dirtiest tactics of all: diplomacy. Since the aliens are among us, and they want money and power, Perry and Miryam will unleash their skills to craft a plan that uses Van, Icky, and Funboy to stop the exploitation of Earth cold, for the enemies are led by a new player in the galactic order.</p> <p>The Tsarina. She's cruel, she's heavily armed, and she's coming for Earthâ€”with a ship that can match anything the Guild has. With enemies at the door, Van finds out that Masters can fail, secrets are hard to keep, and the Earth is worth saving.</p> <p>At any cost.</p>";
