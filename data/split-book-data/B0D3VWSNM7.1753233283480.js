window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Pulse: The Untold Story</i>, an Audible Original from journalist Trevor Aaronson and Western Sound, investigates the Pulse nightclub shooting and raises startling questions about the FBI’s culpability.</p> <p>In a gay nightclub in Orlando on June 12, 2016, the shooter, Omar Mateen, murdered 49 people and wounded 53 others. The attack was the deadliest act of violence against the LGBTQ+ community in US history and the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11.</p> <p>But there’s a story you haven’t heard. The FBI had a secret history with the shooter and his father. To obscure that history, the FBI pushed a false story that the media dutifully carried—that the attacker was a secretly gay Islamist extremist who had chosen to target Pulse and planned the attack for weeks.</p> <p>Through a relentless and thorough investigation, Aaronson uncovers the volatile relationship between the shooter and his father and how their troubled interactions with the FBI lead to a disturbing final question: Could the FBI have prevented the massacre?</p> <p><i>Pulse: The Untold Story </i>is a documentary like no other. It will leave you wondering if anything you’ve heard about this case is true.</p> <p>Warning: This program contains descriptions of violence and death and includes recordings from 911 calls and police body cameras from the night of the shooting. Listener discretion is advised.</p>";
