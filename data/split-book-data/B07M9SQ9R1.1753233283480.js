window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A new beginning, 1,300 years in the past....</p> <p>In medieval Europe, three explorers from the distant future begin an ambitious project: to build a craft capable of reaching the stars. While their leader oversees the construction of a secret underground base in Iceland, the other two travel thousands of miles to negotiate with the rulers of Europe and recruit the most brilliant minds of the age. When the Iceland base comes under attack, the travelers try to return to defend their home, but they are trapped in Paris just as an army of 20,000 Vikings lays siege to the city. To survive, they must defend Paris from the hordes of Norsemen and fight their way back to Iceland to save their new home - and keep the dream of the Iron Dragon alive.</p> <p><i>The Dawn of the Iron Dragon </i>is the second installment in the Iron Dragon trilogy, which began with <i>The Dream of the Iron Dragon</i>. The saga will conclude with <i>The Voyage of the Iron Dragon</i>.</p> <p>The Iron Dragon trilogy is being produced as part of the phenomenally successful Saga of the Iron Dragon Kickstarter, which raised more than $10,000.
