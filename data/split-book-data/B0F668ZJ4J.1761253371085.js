window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>HEADCASE</i> is a ten-episode comedy about neurotic rising hip hop star Ghost (Chris Redd) and his bumpy mental health journey as he navigates therapy, fame, and chaos. After a very public breakdown, his label forces him into sessions with a dorky, white therapist, Gordon (Will Stephen), who has never heard of Ghost. Meanwhile, his relentless manager, Laverne (Bresha Webb), fights to keep his career afloat while chasing her own industry ambitions. His ex-partner-turned-proud-snitch Mack Stacks (Joey Bada$$) is out of jail and out for revenge, and his grifter father (Roy Wood Jr.) is desperate for the spotlight. Is it even possible to just… rap?</p> <p>A sharp satire of the hip hop industry—riffing on everything from the Drake/Kendrick feud to 6ix9ine snitching and more—<i>HEADCASE</i> skewers authenticity, masculinity, and \"sanity\" in modern music.</p> <p>Created by Chris Redd &amp; Will Stephen; written by Chris Redd, Will Stephen, &amp; Achilles Stamatelaky; directed by Achilles Stamatelaky.</p>";
