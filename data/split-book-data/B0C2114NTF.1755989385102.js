window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It seemed like a good idea at the time.</b></p> <p>The allies could sneak a fleet behind enemy lines and destroy the infrastructure the Overlords were using to push them to the brink of existence. As long as the allied fleet didn’t get trapped and obliterated, everything would be great.</p> <p><b>But they got trapped and obliterated.</b></p> <p>Now, the remains of the allied fleet are on the run, with one of the largest Overlord carrier forces ever seen in pursuit. With few allied carriers and fighters remaining, there is nowhere for them to run and nowhere to hide. When they stop, though, one thing is certain—it will be their final stand. For if the Overlord force breaks through them, there is nothing to stop it from driving all the way to Earth and the other home planets and wiping them out for good.</p> <p><b>It's going to take a miracle to save Uplink Squadron and the rest of the fleet. A miracle...or Heaven’s Angels.</b></p>";
