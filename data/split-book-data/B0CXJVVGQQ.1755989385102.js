window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Everyone's favorite lethal SecUnit is back in the next installment in Martha Wells's New York Times bestselling Murderbot Diaries series.</p> <p>Am I making it worse? I think I'm making it worse.</p> <p>Following the events in Network Effect, the Barish-Estranza corporation has sent rescue ships to a newly-colonized planet in peril, as well as additional SecUnits. But if there’s an ethical corporation out there, Murderbot has yet to find it, and if Barish-Estranza can’t have the planet, they’re sure as hell not leaving without something. If that something just happens to be an entire colony of humans, well, a free workforce is a decent runner-up prize.</p> <p>But there’s something wrong with Murderbot; it isn’t running within normal operational parameters. ART’s crew and the humans from Preservation are doing everything they can to protect the colonists, but with Barish-Estranza’s SecUnit-heavy persuasion teams, they’re going to have to hope Murderbot figures out what’s wrong with itself, and fast!</p> <p>Yeah, this plan is... not going to work.</p> <p>Performed by David Cui Cui, Debi Tinsley, Elena Anderson, Bradley Foster Smith, Christopher Walker, Eric Messner, Eva Wilhelm, Karen Novack, Ken Jackson, Khaya Fraites, Laura C. Harris, Lydia Kraniotis, Nanette Savard, Richard Rohan, Scott McCormick, Stewart Crank, Thomas Penny, Triya Leong, Yasmin Tuazon and Zeke Alton.</p>";
