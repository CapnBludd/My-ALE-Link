window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the dying embers of an interstellar war, newly appointed Fleet Commander Galvin Quintos stands as humanity's last hope, staring down the maw of oblivion. Entrusted with the technological marvel, Omninought-Class warship, USS Washington, Quintos embarks on a campaign to engage the merciless Grish Empire's three formidable armadas—Prowess, Torrent, and Pinnacle.</p> <p>Outnumbered and outgunned, Quintos leads the battered vessels of Alpha Fleet in a desperate bid to avert Earth’s Armageddon. But in the heart of galactic conflict, Chaplain Halman Trent, a cunning predator disguised in piety, preys upon the vulnerable, especially the alluring Petty Officer Aubrey Laramie. With whispers of comfort, he exploits her inner turmoil and fuels her darkest desires. All too soon, Trent's influence expands, casting a dark shadow over the entire ship and crew.</p> <p>Things go from bad to worse; in a devastating technological catastrophe, a merciless twist of fate may have doomed XO Gail Pristy to her final gasps, ruthlessly stripping away any chance she has to survive. Will Quintos find the strength to confront his deepest emotions while knowing it’s a fight that’s come too late?</p> <p>Forced to split forces, it’s time to bring the fight to the enemy's doorstep, zero hour has arrived for Quintos and his crew. Orders from EUNF: Breach the impenetrable 50 Star Gun bulwarks guarding the Grish star system—a defensive gauntlet that has thwarted every allied force before them. There's no sugar-coating it; this is a suicide run that cannot be survived but may just buy precious time for Alpha Fleet light-years away.</p>";
