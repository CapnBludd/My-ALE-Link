window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Laurie R. King illuminates the hidden corners of her beloved Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes series in this dynamic story collection. </p> <p>In nine short stories, seven of which have never previously been available in print, and one brand-new, never-before-seen Sherlock Holmes mystery - available together for the first time - Laurie R. King blends her long-running brand of crime fiction with historical treats and narrative sleight of hand. At the heart of the collection is a prequel novella that begins with England's declaration of war in 1914. As told in Mary Russell's teenage diaries, the whip-smart girl investigates familial mysteries, tracks German spies through San Francisco, and generally delights with her extraordinary mind - until an unimaginable tragedy strikes. </p> <p>Here, too, is the case of a professor killed by a swarm of bees; Mrs. Hudson's investigation of a string of disappearing household items - and a lifelong secret; a revealing anecdote about a character integral to <i>The God of the Hive</i>; the story of Mary's beloved uncle Jake and a monumental hand of cards; and a series of postcards in which Mary searches for her missing husband, Sherlock Holmes. </p> <p>Last but not least, fans will be especially thrilled by Mary's account of her decision, at age 92, to publish her memoirs - and how she concluded that Ms. King should be the one to introduce her voice to the world. </p>";
