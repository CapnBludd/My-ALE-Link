window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Deathmatch</i> is now a number-one best seller in postapocalyptic science fiction, number one in dystopian science fiction, number one in military science fiction, and number one in war fiction. </p> <p>Humanity's most fearsome enemy is no longer death. </p> <p><b>Alpha and Marsoc meet their match</b> </p> <p>Lurking in the bush is the dark shadow cast by the operators - a terrifying force every bit their equal in skill, ferocity, and sheer resolve...but utterly unconstrained by humanity, compassion, or brotherhood. Now, to complete their mission and save the world, the operators will have to pay with their lives, or their souls, or possibly both. </p> <p><b>One troop descends into hell</b> </p> <p>Rolling the dice on a last-ditch plan to save London by retrieving the Kazakh's zombie-annihilating virus, Jameson leads his last best men into the dragon's den - an underground bunker home to the savage and hyperskilled Spetsnaz Alfa group. Getting out alive is a million-to-one shot - and then their real problems begin. </p> <p><b>The <i>Kennedy</i> is burning</b> </p> <p>The world's deadliest maritime commando force were made homeless when their battlecruiser went to the bottom of the Atlantic. Now they're looking for payback - and a replacement nuclear-powered warship. But not only is the whole <i>JFK</i> in play - so is Dr. Park, his vaccine design, and thus the fate of the entire world. </p>";
