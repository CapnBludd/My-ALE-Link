window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's the season for treason …<br> The king of Yusan must die.<br> <br> The five most dangerous liars in the land have been mysteriously summoned to work together for a single objective: to kill the god king Joon.<br> <br> He has it coming. Under his merciless immortal hand, the nobles flourish, while the poor and innocent are imprisoned, ruined … or sold.<br> <br> And now each of the five blades will come for him. Each has tasted bitterness—from the hired hit man seeking atonement, a lovely assassin who seeks freedom, or even the prince banished for his cruel crimes. None can resist the sweet, icy lure of vengeance.<br> <br> They can agree on murder.<br> They can agree on treachery.<br> <br> But for these five killers—each versed in deception, lies, and betrayal—it’s not enough to forge an alliance. To survive, they’ll have to find a way to trust each other … but only one can take the crown.<br> <br> Let the best liar win.<br> <br> This audiobook is narrated by Donald Chang, Greg Chun, Zion Jang, Sophie Oda, Jaine Ye, and Roger Yeh.</p>";
