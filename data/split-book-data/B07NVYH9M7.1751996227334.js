window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Earth’s last survivors are racing against time—and through it.</b></p> <p>A mysterious wave of light has swept across the globe, erasing all animal life from the planet in an instant. Now, two survivors are all that remain—one stranded on a ravaged Earth and the other newly rescued from the decaying International Space Station. Their struggle for survival and reunion soon spirals into something much larger, plunging them into a cosmic battle that transcends time, space, and even reality itself.</p> <p>In the silent, ghostly ruins of Geneva, an alien force has risen, constructing an unearthly city from the ashes of humanity’s greatest achievements. The origin? A rift opened at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, a gateway to alternate universes and worlds ravaged by the same merciless invaders. As they piece together the dark truth, the survivors must navigate parallel dimensions, face a xenophobic enemy bent on wiping all life from the multiverse, and confront a deadly time loop that seems determined to trap them forever. With each new world they encounter, hope for salvation dims. But together, they’re willing to risk everything—not only for a chance at survival but to rewrite the very fabric of reality and save a multiverse on the brink of extinction.</p> <p><i>Multitude</i> is a journey of survival and sacrifice, a mind-bending adventure across worlds where reality fractures and bends. Will Earth’s last two survivors unravel the mystery in time—or will their struggle die across endless, desolate worlds, alone and unremembered?</p> <p><b>Start </b><b><i>Multitude</i></b><b> Today!</b></p> <p><b>Listen to the entire </b><b><i>Dimension Space</i></b><b> universe!</b></p> <p><i>Solitude</i></p> <p><i>Multitude</i></p> <p><i>Amplitude</i></p> <p><i>Magnitude</i></p> <p><i>Fortitude</i></p> <p><i>Infinitude</i> (Coming Soon)</p> <p><b>Start </b><b><i>Multitude</i></b><b> Today!</b></p>";
