Stretching across multiple art forms and genres, the movement taps into the limitless potential of creativity and the imagination to envision Black liberation through stories, music, architecture, fashion, music, and so much more.</p> <p>In the six lessons of <b>From The Wiz to Wakanda: Afrofuturism in Pop Culture</b>, Grace D. Gipson of Virginia Commonwealth University will trace the history of the movement and introduce you to the writers, artists, and creators who are revisiting the past as they build a new vision for the future. From the work of pioneering Black writers like W. E. B. DuBois to the blockbuster <i>Black Panther</i> films and beyond, youâ€™ll see how Afrofuturism is an ongoing cultural project that grows stronger and more multifaceted with each new generation of Afrofuturist creators.</p> <p>A movement of both reclamation and innovation, Afrofuturism offers unique perspectives that will only continue to grow and evolve, challenging us to rethink the way we engage with history, pop culture, and our conception of the future. By fostering creative visions that push boundaries and shatter stereotypes, the Afrofuturist movement brings new, diverse narratives to life that are transforming our pop culture landscape in revolutionary ways.</p>";
