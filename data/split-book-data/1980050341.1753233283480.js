window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Return to the alternate universe of <i>1632</i> and <i>1633 </i>as the top writers of alternate history and military SF join forces in the shared-universe volume of the year. </p> <p>The battle between democracy and tyranny is joined, and the American Revolution has begun over a century ahead of schedule. A cosmic accident has shifted a modern West Virginia town back through time and space to land it and its 20th century technology in Germany in the middle of the Thirty Years War. History must take a new course as American freedom and democracy battle against the squabbling despots of 17th century Europe. </p> <p>Continuing the story begun in the hit novels <i>1632 </i>and <i>1633</i>, the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling creator of Honor Harrington, David Weber, the best-selling fantasy star Mercedes Lackey, space adventure author K. D. Wentworth, Dave Freer, co-author of the hit novels <i>Rats, Bats &amp; Vats</i> and <i>Pyramid Scheme</i> (both Baen), and Eric Flint himself combine their considerable talents in a shared-universe volume that will be a must-have for every listener of <i>1632 </i>and <i>1633</i>.</p>";
