window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Van and his crew have killed an empire.</b></p> <p>The problem is the empire doesn’t know it’s dead. Moving among the stars, the Peacemakers are faced with their greatest challenge—removing an evil so vast, it has a presence in every known star system.</p> <p>To that end, they’ll need to move quickly. To do so, they must be mobile, and that means big changes in their tactics. . . and their crew. With the help of a shadowy figure known as the Body Thief, Van will continue his policy of justice and freedom for all citizens, even if they began life on a computer chip.</p> <p>In the deepest reaches of known space, the Fafnir will seek new technologies from old sources, arming their ranks against enemies who use force before reason and weapons before words. And this time, they’ll have advice from a being who might be as old as the stars themselves—if they can come to an understanding about what it truly means to be alive.</p>";
