window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A window is but a piece of glass through which we view the world outside. It is not meant to distort. It is not intended to do anything but show us things as they are.</p> <p>At Oxford, though, there is a very particular window that reveals a very particular view. It is a view that defies all laws of nature and science. And when a detective is called in to investigate, he is startled to find that view opens a window into his own life–and a mystery he has never been able to solve.</p> <p><i>The Girl Who Wasn't There</i> is written by Arvind Ethan David and stars Malachi Kirby as Ernest Underwood and Sarita Choudhury as Sara Adler-Denning.</p> <p><i>Earworms</i> is a series of short, speculative fiction dramas–tales of what might have been...or might yet be...or perhaps in fact are, if only you were paying attention...if only you were listening.</p>";
