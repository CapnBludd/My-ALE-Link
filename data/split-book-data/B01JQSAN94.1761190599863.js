window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Author of the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novels <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> and <i>The Fountains of Paradise</i> along with such memorable novels as <i>Childhood's End</i>, Sir Arthur C. Clarke was - with Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein - one of the writers who defined the classic era of science fiction. From early work like \"Rescue Party\" and \"The Lion of Comarre\" through classic stories including \"The Star\", \"Earthlight\", \"The Nine Billion Names of God\", and \"The Sentinel\" (kernel of the later novel and movie <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>), all the way to later work like \"A Meeting with Medusa\" and \"The Hammer of God\", this comprehensive short story collection encapsulates one of the great science fiction careers of all time. </p>";
