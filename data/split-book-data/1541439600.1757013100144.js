window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When an inexplicable cosmic disturbance hurls your town from 20th century West Virginia back to 17th century Europe - and into the middle of the Thirty Years War - you'd better be adaptable to survive. And the natives of that time period, faced with American technology and politics, need to be equally adaptable. </p> <p>In other stories: </p> <p>● Cardinal Richelieu, France's insidious master plotter and power behind the throne, learns of his prominent role in Dumas' not-yet-written novel <i>The Three Musketeers</i> (not to mention the several movie versions), and starts a search for the \"real\" D'Artagnan. </p> <p>● Grantville is selling crystal radio sets so that Europeans can tune in to the <i>Voice of America</i> broadcasts, but the technicians from the future are at wit's end, trying to reproduce \"primitive\" early twentieth century broadcasting equipment by trial and error - until a trained library researcher shows up in town. </p> <p>● Wilhelm Krieger, one of Germany's greatest philosophers, comes to Grantville to learn the philosophy of the future - and meets a contrarian cracker-barrel philosopher. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
