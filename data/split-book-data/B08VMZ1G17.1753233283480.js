window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Comic-Con, 2036. The world is rocked by the bizarre and inexplicable materialization of Cateklysm Catholicon - a colorfully clad whack job decreeing that humanity's only hope lies in the lessons found in superhero comic books. \"Cateklysm's Challenge\" is born, enticing even the most skeptical with a prize that promises \"the power to change the world\". </p> <p>But two decades later, the world has gone to crap. The prize, the challenge, and Cateklysm himself have all been forgotten by everyone but the Chowderheads - diehard superhero worshippers, who champion the progressive ideology infused into comics.</p> <p>Enter Clayton Clayborn, a tragically orphaned, 17-year-old, second-generation Chowderhead living a dystopian nightmare existence on a Martian space freighter. Obsessed with the challenge, he'll face a gauntlet of comic book nerdery that will take him to alien worlds, thrust him into gladiatorial combat against supervillain look-alikes, and push him to the brink of annihilation in the heart of what seems to be the Batcave. But as Stan Lee would put it, \"Excelsior.\"</p> <p>\"The comic book nerd's <i>Ready Player One</i>... Fun, frenetic, creative, and the ending hits like a ton of bricks.\" (<i>Portland Book Review</i>)</p>";
