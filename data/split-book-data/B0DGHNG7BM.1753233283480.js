window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Will Johnnie Veal—convicted of the murder of two police officers in 1970—be granted parole after 50 years in prison? How can he convince the parole board he’s reformed when he insists he’s innocent? What is prison time even supposed to accomplish? These are the questions that propel <i>The Parole Room</i> forward as it builds toward Johnnie’s 20th parole hearing—after 19 rejections.</p> <p><i>The Parole Room</i> is an intimate journey with Johnnie, a deep dive into the criminal legal system, and a parole-room drama—taking listeners behind the curtain to hear tense deliberations as they unfold. The series is vivid, emotional, and complex, bringing new questions and insights about the US justice system and the country as a whole.</p> <p>From the writer of the critically acclaimed book <i>Correction</i> and the producer behind the Pulitzer Prize- and Peabody Award-winning podcast <i>You Didn’t See Nothin</i>, <i>The Parole Room</i> is necessary storytelling for our time.</p>";
