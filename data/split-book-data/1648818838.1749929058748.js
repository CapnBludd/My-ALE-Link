window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The galaxy just called for help. Unfortunately, the wrong man answered. </p> <p>When small-time con man Cal Carver is thrown in jail and forced to share a cell with a semi-naked, cannibalistic serial killer, he's pretty sure his day can't get any worse. Boy, is he wrong. It isn't until two-thirds of the human race is wiped out and Cal is mistakenly abducted by aliens that things really start to go downhill.</p> <p>Whisked across the galaxy, Cal is forced into a team of some of the sector's most notorious villains and scumbags and tasked with delivering a package to a warlord-run solar system where the authorities daren't venture. The mission should be simple enough, but as one screwup leads to another the ragtag group of unwitting heroes find themselves in a frantic battle to save an entire alien civilization - and its god - from total annihilation. </p> <p>Performed by Phil Thron, Danny Gavigan, Carolyn Kashner, Darius Johnson, Yasmin Tuazon, Bradley Smith, Henry W.
