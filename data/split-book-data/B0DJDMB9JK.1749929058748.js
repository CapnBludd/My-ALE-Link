During their escape, a dying Admiral Jessup tells Axel he must lead the resistance, and that he must start it where his father made his last stand, on the mining world of Furia.</p> <p>On the planet Runi, Sergeant Jax Brito returns to her family farm to find her father on his deathbed. After dealing with the thugs that put him there, her trip is cut short when a Clipper arrives with a message—the Citadel has been attacked and forces are gathering to take it back. With the threat of the Wrath burning closer, Jax heads out on a new mission. Unknown to her, the journey will take her somewhere no human has set foot.</p> <p>Having survived capture on Dari, bounty hunter Rangnar Soki faces a new mission. The former galactic king of Wrath artifacts is tasked with locating alien technology that has killed everyone who went searching for it. If he can manage to survive, he might have a chance of helping defeat the enemy. But it will take more than ancient technology and weapons to destroy the Wrath. All species will have to unite to win this war, and only one warrior can rally them—the last Steward.</p>";
