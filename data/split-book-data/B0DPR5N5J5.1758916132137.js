Paris, and more of the world’s leading thriller writers.</b></p> <p>Dr. Margaret Richter has it all. She’s rich, thanks to her best-selling self-help books. She has a beautiful home in Cape Cod overlooking the beach. And she has a monthly book club that everyone is dying to get invited to.</p> <p>Literally.</p> <p>Because behind the crystal wine glasses, the fine linens and the catered hors d'oeuvres lies a tangled web of secrets, of deceit, of murder. No member of the book club is innocent—and many are guilty.</p> <p>And the person with the most to hide is Margaret Richter herself.</p> <p>With an introduction by best-selling author Jennifer Weiner, <i>The Twisted Women’s Book Club</i> was created in partnership with International Thriller Writers. Special thanks to Joseph Finder, Gregg Hurwitz and Kimberley Howe.</p> <p>Full cast of narrators include: Lauren Ezzo, Stephanie Epstein, Jenn Lee, Brittany Pressley, Cindy Kay, Nancy Wu, Nicola F.
