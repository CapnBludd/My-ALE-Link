window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The sixth rollicking anthology of tales set in Eric Flint's phenomenal <i>New York Times </i>best-selling Ring of Fire universe. </p> <p>A cosmic accident sets the modern West Virginia town of Grantville down in war-torn 17th-century Europe. It will take all the gumption of the resourceful, freedom-loving up-timers to find a way to flourish in the mad and bloody birth of the Renaissance. Are they up for it? You bet they are. </p> <p>Edited by Eric Flint and inspired by his now-legendary <i>1632</i>, this is the fun stuff that fills in the pieces of the Ring of Fire political, social, and cultural puzzle as supporting characters we meet in the novels get their own lives, loves, and life-changing stories. The future and democracy have arrived with a bang. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
