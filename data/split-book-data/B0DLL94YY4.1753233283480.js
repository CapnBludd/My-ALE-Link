window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There are some secrets you just can’t bury.</b></p> <p>A gripping Audible Original for fans of Jane Harper’s <i>The Dry </i>and Sarah Pearse’s <i>The Sanatorium</i>, <i>The Teacher’s Lie</i> is a psychological thriller set on the harsh and rugged South Australian coast, performed by Mia Wasikowska (<i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, <i>The Kids Are All Right</i>).</p> <p>It’s been two years since Anna Cartwright’s life fell apart. During her first school trip as a young teacher, a student went missing and was never found. Not only was her career ruined, she was also accused of having an affair with fellow teacher and prime suspect Graham. Facing questions from journalists, police and family, Anna said she didn’t know what happened. She was lying.</p> <p>Now, Anna has returned to Australia. Her only hope is Land’s End Area School, an isolated concrete wasteland perched on the cliffs. The failing institution is so understaffed that it is the one place her history might remain hidden. But while the eccentric Headmistress seems welcoming, deputy-head Miss Baxter seems determined to expose her secrets.</p> <p><b>With new lies spinning out of control, how long can Anna keep her secret hidden? And is she being haunted by her guilt or by something far more sinister?</b></p>";
