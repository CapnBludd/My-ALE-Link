window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Welcome to WATCH DOGS: TRUTH, Audible's first original interactive audio experience.</b></p> <p>After Dedsec's heroic actions in the Zero Day affair, the government publicly praised their role in saving the city. However, this reset of relations was short-lived. A new crackdown on civil freedoms is underway, as the surveillance state fights back against growing activism and protest.</p> <p>The government's cyber intelligence force, SIRS, has been directed to orchestrate a sinister campaign of message manipulation, fake news, and discrediting dissent. With the rise of deepfakes and fake news, the line between truth and falsehood has become nearly impossible to discern.</p> <p>But Dedsec is fighting back. When they uncover a troubling instance of this disinformation, they realize the threat is far more organized and nefarious than it first appeared. Now they must convince the implementers to change course - using the targeted tactics Dedsec is known for.</p> <p>As you listen, you'll be guided through this story by Bagley, who can access any CTOS device, including your own Optik. At the end of each episode, you'll be asked to make choices that will determine Dedsec's next move. The fate of the city hangs in the balance.
