But even that is not as terrible as having to work for his overbearing father, the local copper for the pretty seaside town of Roundstone. </p> <p>For some, like Anna and her young daughter, Tilly, Roundstone is a refuge from trauma. But even this village on the edge of the sea isn’t far enough to escape from the shadows of evil men. </p>";
