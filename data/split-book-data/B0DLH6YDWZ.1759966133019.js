Greatest Britain: For a Global Universe.</b></p> <p>Strap yourself in and maybe put on a crash helmet, Agent Isaac Steele has another case to crack.</p> <p>The theft of the Best Idea in the Universe from Thresia's Intergalactic Bank of Ideas plunges the Discovered Universe into chaos. With a robotic partner who’s not the machine he fell in love with and a mind as cool and measured as a forest fire, Isaac must unravel a cosmic conspiracy that stretches further than the reaches of even his depraved imagination.</p> <p>Earth and Thresia teeter on the brink of war as the race to recover the Best Idea intensifies. Yet in this bizarre Universe, truth proves stranger - and far more perilous - than fiction.</p> <p>So put on that helmet and possibly add kneepads actually for a mind-bending journey through space, time, and the occasional bar in this latest adventure from the brilliantly warped mind of BAFTA winner Daniel Rigby.</p> <p><b>Available in Dolby Atmos</b></p>";
