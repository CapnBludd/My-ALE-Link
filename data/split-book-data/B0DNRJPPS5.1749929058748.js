window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Get ready to experience two more origin stories in the Backyard Starship universe.</b></p> <p><b><i>Red Agent</i></b></p> <p>Legendary Peacemaker Petyrn Groshenko wasn't always on the good side of the law.</p> <p>As a young agent of the KGB, the murder of his father sets events in motion that begin with Petyr doing something beyond his wildest dreams. He leaves the earth. In a starship. And not of his own volition. Abducted by an alien con artist, Petyr Groshenko holds the key to a mystery worth millions—or billions—of bonds, thanks to an ancient secret that began in Russia, passed through Tunisia, and ends in the most unlikely place of all, thanks to a clever American soldier who kept a promise across the years and miles.</p> <p>To find the treasure, Petyr is going to need luck, help, and the wits of an alien who is far more than she appears to be.</p> <p>Join Petyr as he begins the journey of a lifetime in this origin story from the Backyard Starship universe. Even legends have to start somewhere, and for Petyr Groshenko, it begins here, in <i>Red Agent.</i></p> <p><b><i>Career Moves</i></b></p> <p>Before Van went to the stars, Mark Tudor was there—but he wasn't alone.</p> <p>Perry was Mark's guardian, advisor, and friend, serving decades as they battled for the forces of good, solving cases and stopping crime of all kinds.</p> <p>Between Mark and Van, there was a gap in time where Perry was faced with a choice. Serve the Guild, do what's right, and take the next step in a career measured in centuries, not years. In this thrilling look at Perry's history, find out what happens when an AI feels the greatest loss of all—and moves on, honoring a duty that spans time and the stars themselves.</p>";
