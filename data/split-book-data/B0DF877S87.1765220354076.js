window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the Krygians, a soulless insectile alien race, attack a Floritineian goodwill convoy, annihilating their fleet and stealing the precious cargo, the U.S. Space Navy reaches out to the one person who can do the impossible: Captain Galvin Quintos. Tasked with the covert 'Quansport Ops' mission aboard <i>USS Ike</i>, a far smaller Corvette-class warship than he’s used to, Quintos must navigate treacherous alliances and cutting-edge tech to reclaim a warship that cannot be allowed to be in enemy hands—<i>Oblivion</i>—an Extinction-class Dreadnought that years earlier he’d been forced to surrender to another enemy.</p> <p>As <i>USS Ike</i> springs into battle against impossible odds, Quintos uncomfortably stands quiet as new and untested EUNF battle tech is thrown into the all-too-real boots-on-the-ground combat against the alien bugs. With genetically enhanced Marines, untested bio-mech Symbios, and a dangerously unstable AI as his only weapons against the might of the Krygian threat, the crew has one chance to put this new adversary in their place. But when faced with an enemy that outnumbers humans by the trillions, can one small ship turn the tide of the war?</p> <p>To make matters worse, Quintos' pirate past has returned to haunt him with a vengeance. His niece Sonya has been abducted and the unthinkable is set in motion—an arranged marriage to the son of the once ruthless pirate, Cardinal Thunderballs. As if the weight of the galaxy wasn't enough, Quintos must also navigate the turbulent waters of his unresolved relationship with XO Gail Pristy. With his personal life in shambles and the Quansport Ops mission on the brink of catastrophe, he must dig deep to confront the demons that plague him from within and without.</p> <p>The <i>USS Hamilton Series</i> continues with <i>USS Ike—Quansport Ops</i>, the latest heart-pounding SciFi thriller guaranteed to leave you breathless.</p>";
