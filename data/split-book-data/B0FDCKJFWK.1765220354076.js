Sensing massive profits, the scramble to exploit humanity pits Van against his own people—and Yotov, whose plans have finally come to fruition.</p> <p>With political warfare, the Equal Grasp seeks to do what missiles cannot—remove Van from the picture. But he's a lot tougher than that. Icky's hammer is swinging freely, and the crew are international stars, portrayed as the heroes of a world that reaches beyond the sky, into deepest space and beyond.</p> <p>With one last throw of the dice, Yotov will unleash the hidden reserve of power she's been hiding. If it works, Van will be dead. Or worse.</p> <p>Because Yotov and the Equal Grasp don't just want power; they want control of life itself, and they'll stop at nothing to get it.</p>";
