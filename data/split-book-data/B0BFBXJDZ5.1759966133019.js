window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>USS Adams: No Escape--b</i></b><b>ook 6 of the USS </b><b><i>Hamilton</i></b><b> Series</b></p> <p>Captain Galvin Quintos, along with his irreverent crew, is back and facing his most harrowing enemy yet. As the battle within the Eta Carinae Star System rages on with the Varapin, Quintos is forced to make a deal with the devil, one Commander Dunft Choob. Sure, Quintos has saved the pirate world of Haven—but at a heavy price. <i>Oblivion</i>, the most powerful warship in the known galaxy, will be reluctantly returned to the Varapin ghouls. Pleidian Empress Shawlee arrives on the scene, bringing with her two familiar dreadnoughts, USS <i>Hamilton</i> and USS <i>Jefferson, </i>but also a new dreadnought, USS <i>Adams</i>—a ship recommissioned and converted to a Gilded Age luxury liner, then, all too quickly, turned back into a warship. She might not be ready for the demands of Quintos’ crew—not to mention intergalactic warfare—but there is no time to figure that out. If that’s not stressful enough for Quintos, Doc Viv is about to share something that will bring him to his knees.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Captain Gail Pristy is keeping vigil over Quintos’ secret hideaway back within the Lost Tombstone Star System. She now asks just one thing of Quintos<i>—</i>find the Varapin transport ship <i>Boundless Wrath,</i> which has imprisoned her EUNF US Space-Navy crew members. While locating the ship might not be difficult for Quintos, chasing her down will be. Inexplicably, both ships find themselves within an alternate universe—with propulsion and weapons systems offline. Now, a hostile alien species called the Ziu, with many hundreds of warships, is quickly closing in on them.</p>";
