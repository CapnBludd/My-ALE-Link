window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The enemy took everything from Fin. And he wants it back.</b></p> <p>First, they stole his dog. Then they destroy his ship. And after a violent space station attack, they devastate his home in the stars.</p> <p>Unidentified enemy forces execute a spectacularly violent assault within the Union on a Ranger Corps-affiliated space station. Fearful of a mole in their ranks, the Ranger Corps locks down all nearby space stations and planetary systems as they seek to flush out the traitor.</p> <p>Complicating the matter, the enemy liberated a cadre of the galaxy’s most dangerous outlaws from the Rangers’ Protected Species Division prisons. And with the prisoners, they kidnapped many of Fin’s allies, including stalwart friend Warrox.</p> <p>Fin, Renata, Drake, Audrey, Theta, and a freshly rescued Jacques must outmaneuver the Ranger Corps’ own security protocols in frantic pursuit of their close allies and the Ranger Corps fugitives.</p> <p>As if this mission weren’t already personal enough, the raiders of the Ranger Corps station may also be responsible for the disappearance of Drake’s broodmates.</p> <p>With no support and a brand-new spaceship salvaged from an intergalactic junkyard, Fin and the crew embark on their most perilous mission yet. They have only one advantage: Jacques is back and ready for action. Or at least moral support.</p> <p><b>Book 3 of this rollicking sci-fi adventure from Anthony J. Melchiorri. It's perfect for fans of JN Chaney, MR Forbes, and </b><b><i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</i></b></p>";
