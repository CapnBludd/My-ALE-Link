In this hour of despair, Prime Minister Winston Churchill receives a mysterious letter from an even more mysterious woman, offering a Faustian bargain and a promise of victory. But if Churchill accepts, will he be condemning his nation’s very soul?</p> <p><i>Darkness Visible </i>is based on the graphic novel of the same name, written by Mike Carey and Arvind Ethan David, and stars Christian McKay as Winston Churchill and Miranda Richardson as Lady Vivian.</p> <p><i>Earworms</i> is a series of short, speculative fiction dramas–tales of what might have been...or might yet be...or perhaps in fact are, if only you were paying attention...if only you were listening.</p>";
