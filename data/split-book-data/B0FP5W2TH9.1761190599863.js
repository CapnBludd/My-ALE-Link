She’s claimed her own corner of the library, cozied up with her favorite novels and a ghost cat named Nicodemus. She’s the deep thinker among her more tempestuous sisters, so she isn’t prepared to be swept up in a real-life romantic adventure in the form of sexy local baker Iggy Galinsky.</p> <p>Iggy is tired of his reputation as the Island’s unreliable charmer and a man of many talents but no true calling outside his family’s bakery. Sure, it’s mostly true, but it still hurts his feelings. His carefree life gets serious fast when he meets the beautiful, mysterious Cora Seaworth. Before long, they’re working together with Cora’s sisters, various ghosts and the unfathomable creature lurking at the bottom of the cove to defeat an ancient enemy. If they don’t prevail, it’s not just their love that’s at stake, but Starfall Point’s entire magical community.</p>";
