window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The entire four-book Trackers series in one bundle: over 30 hours of post-apocalyptic survival fiction and action. </b></p> <p><b>No power. No rules. No help coming.</b></p> <p><b><i>The end of the world is just the beginning of the hunt....</i></b></p> <p>Five days ago, North Korea detonated three strategically placed nuclear warheads over the United States, triggering an electromagnetic pulse that crippled the country. A second attack destroyed the nerve center of America in a nuclear blast that flattened the nation's capital. As the government falls apart in the aftermath, the survivors must decide how far they will go to save the ones they love. </p> <p>In this lawless new world where the most ruthless thrive while innocents suffer, a sheriff, a retired marine, a nurse, and a senator turned secretary of defense are faced with keeping their communities and families safe. One thing is certain - they won't be able to save everyone. Not with their humanity still intact. </p> <p>The explosive Trackers series is a harrowing story of survival and a realistic depiction of what an EMP attack and the aftermath might look like from former Homeland Security disaster mitigation officer and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Nicholas Sansbury Smith. Packed full of action, survival tips, and a unique twist on the EMP genre, the Trackers series has thrilled hundreds of thousands of fans across the world. </p>";
