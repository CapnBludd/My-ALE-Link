window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The critically acclaimed author of </b><b><i>Alien: The Cold Forge</i></b><b> takes listeners to a rogue colony where terror lurks in the tunnels of an abandoned Weyland-Yutani complex.</b></p> <p>“Shy” Hunt and the tech team from McAllen Integrations thought they’d have an easy job - set up environmental systems for the brand new Hasanova Data Solutions colony, built on the abandoned ruins of a complex known as “Charybdis”. There are just two problems: The colony belongs to the Iranian state, so diplomacy is strained at best, and the complex is located above a series of hidden caves that contain deadly secrets. When a bizarre ship lands on a nearby island, one of the workers is attacked by a taloned creature, and trust evaporates between the Iranians and Americans. The McAllen Integrations crew is imprisoned, accused as spies, but manages to send out a distress signal - to the Colonial Marines.</p>";
