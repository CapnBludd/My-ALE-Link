window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Boarding a transport ship after the Battle of Gettysburg, Colonel Andrew Keane and his 35th Maine regiment are swept into an alternate world. The first human civilization they encounter on this planet resembles medieval Russia, with boyars and priests ruling over the peasants and townspeople. Soon Keane and his regiment learn this world's terrible secret: that cannibalistic hordes of large, fierce Tugars circle the planet and demand tribute - including humans to be devoured. And the hordes will be arriving sooner than expected, with several hundred thousand warriors on horseback. </p> <p>Using all their 19th century know-how, Keane and his men build a new society with railroads and ironworks, and with skill, cooperation, and courage, the regiment and most of the Russians work together in hopes of defeating the horde. </p> <p>A great story of survival and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds. First novel in the acclaimed Lost Regiment series by the author of <i>One Second After</i>, <i>One Year After</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Day of Wrath</i>. </p>";
