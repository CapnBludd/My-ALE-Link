window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Relax to the natural symphony of steady rain in Olympic National Park in Washington, as the raindrops plunk onto leaves, drip into puddles, and course down the grooved bark of ancient trees. </p> <p>Unlike canned nature sounds created in a studio, renowned acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton gives you the real deal. He travels the world recording remarkable locations that capture the essence of the place itself. His lifelong mission is to preserve nature through sound, and his soundscapes are produced with such care and quality that you feel as if he has truly brought a slice of the world into your home. </p> <p>This title is part of The Audible Sleep Collection, exclusive audio experiences created to invite relaxation and sleep.
