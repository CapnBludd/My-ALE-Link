window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A mysterious cosmic force the Ring of Fire has hurled the town of Grantville from 20th century West Virginia back to 17th century Europe, and into the heart of the Thirty Years War. With their seemingly magical technology, and their radical ideas of freedom and justice, the time-lost West Virginians have allied with Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, to form the Confederated Principalities of Europe, changing the course of history in ways both small and large. </p> <p>The saga begun in 1632 continues with all-new stories by <i>New York Times</i> best-selling authors Eric Flint and Andrew Dennis, plus Dave Freer, K. D. Wentworth, and other top writers, as the time-lost Americans attempt an underwater salvage operation to raise the sunken Swedish flagship, the uprising known as the Ram Rebellion continues, Cardinal Richelieu plots to destroy Grantville and its allies, an American prisoner of war carries on a dangerous romance with the Danish Kings daughter, and more in a volume that no fan of the Ring of Fire series will want to be without.</p>";
