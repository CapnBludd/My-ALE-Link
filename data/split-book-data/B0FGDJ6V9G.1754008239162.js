A cracked stove. Scribbles on the wall. The lights flicking off every evening — always at the same time. Our daughter crying in the night, pointing at the corner of her room. \"She has no face.\"</p> <p>Then I met Josie, the woman at No. 3.</p> <p>Pale. Polite. Smiling. Obsessed. She knows things she shouldn't. Offers to babysit my daughter again and again. And when I told her no — she didn't like that.</p> <p>Now the gifts are arriving. Notes through the door. A bottle left in the kitchen with no explanation. And my daughter won't stop screaming in her sleep.</p> <p>Everyone thinks I'm imagining it. But I know what I saw. What I heard.</p> <p>We finally found our dream home. But what if the nightmare lives next door . . . ?</p>";
