window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three friends from small-town Pennsylvania set out to conquer Denali, North America's highest peak, but only two come down alive. On the mountain, their grand adventure unravels into a harrowing tale of survival, betrayal, and the haunting consequences of ambition pushed too far. For fans of <i>Into Thin Air</i>, <i>Touching the Void</i>, and <i>127 Hours</i>, <i>Denali </i>has a full cast, jaw-dropping twists, and immersive sound design that will transport you to one of the most extreme environments on earth.</p> <p>When their best friend Josh proposes a daring climb of Alaska’s perilous summit, aspiring writer Finn (Jack Falahee, <i>How to Get Away with Murder</i>) sees it as his ticket to literary success, and local lifer Doug (Jake Lacy, <i>The White Lotus</i>) signs up for the challenge. But as the trio ascends into the deadly \"Death Zone,\" long-buried secrets and rivalries emerge, threatening to tear them apart before the mountain does.</p> <p>Told through a masterful blend of present-day scenes, excerpts from Finn’s now best-selling memoir, and their pulse-pounding ascent, <i>Denali</i> keeps listeners on edge, slowly revealing the mystery of what really happened on that fateful expedition. As Abby (Amrit Kaur, <i>Sex Lives of College Girls</i>), Josh’s sister, pieces together conflicting accounts years later, she’s forced to confront unsettling questions about the brother she thought she knew—and the man she's chosen to love.</p> <p><i>Denali</i> explores the complex bonds of friendship, the seductive power of fame, and the psychological toll of surviving when others do not.</p> <p>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
