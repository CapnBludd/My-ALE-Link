The 32 might be a myth. And an entire race has chosen Van Tudor as their enemy—and they'll stop at nothing to end his life in the name of power and money.</p> <p>The threat isn't just among the stars. For the first time in his career, Van must protect his home planet from people who look at humans as a resource—and Peacemakers as the key to untold wealth. With Van's decision comes long-term effects and an Earth that is no longer alone in the universe, but connected to the stars...</p> <p>And at risk from every danger in known space.</p> <p>The decision is now. The battle is now. And the crown is heavier than one Peacemaker might be able to carry—unless he has a little help from his friends.</p>";
