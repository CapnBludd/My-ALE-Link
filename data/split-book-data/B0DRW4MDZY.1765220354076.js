To continue the fight and the case, the crew and friends need more than just contacts. They need money.</p> <p>To that end, Van begins exploring an old mystery about his grandfather, which leads to the shocking discovery—the Earth is being stripped of its history, one object at a time, but that's not the main purpose of the criminals.</p> <p>Their goals are bigger than just stealing art. Much bigger. One of their targets is nothing less than the end of the Fafnir and Van and everything he represents.</p> <p>Along the way, Icky learns about motherhood, and Funboy learns about grief, and everyone agrees that cheese is good and pants are bad—sort of.</p> <p>There's a time and place for everything, and Van will lead his crew for as long as he can.</p> <p>If he can stay alive—and that's a pretty big if.</p>";
