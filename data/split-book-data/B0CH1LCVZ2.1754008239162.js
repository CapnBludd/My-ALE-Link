window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this thrilling dystopian space-opera, escapees flee a ravaged Earth—but what's more dangerous: the wasteland of their past or the one that lies ahead?</b></p> <p>Having obliterated entire civilizations, the Torth Majority is now threatening humanity itself. Barreling through deep space—and hunted every dark mile by armadas, saboteurs, and kamikaze armies—the passengers of a refugee streamship must outrun everything they left behind if they hope to stay alive.</p> <p>Instilled with illegal superpowers, Ariock is a literal giant among gladiators. It's in his blood: his legendary great-grandfather outwitted the Torth, and Ariock himself dared to betray them. Thomas, on the other hand, is a supergenius. Sure, he's physically disadvantaged, but his mind is a brainwashing, telepathic, terrifying wonder to behold. What he's done to outlast the abuses of his youth is something of a mystery . . . and possibly malevolent. Not even Vy, his caretaker and foster sister, knows all of Thomas's secrets.</p> <p>What all three share is a fear of the unknown. Their ship on the last dregs of fuel, they crash-land on a distant planet still under the toxic, storm-filled fallout of an ancient nuclear war. Turns out this hell-scape is the ancestral homeworld of the Torth. And while that savage empire couldn't withstand this poisoned sludge of a planet, it doesn't mean they're not still guarding it.</p> <p>On a predatory world of mutant monstrosities and relentless galactic enemies, Thomas foresees nothing but death and defeat. But it's do-or-die for Ariock and the streamship exiles who are fighting to survive—and somehow find light in a dead city of eternal night.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit sci-fi fantasy series—with more than 750,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
