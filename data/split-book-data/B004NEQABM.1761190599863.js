window.bookSummaryJSON = "<b>From a #1 bestselling author, a formidable assassin is assigned his most dangerous mission yet in this “home run” of an espionage thriller (David Baldacci, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author).</b><br><br> It is the fall of 1951, and the Korean War is raging. Twenty-six-year-old Nicholai Hel has spent the last three years in solitary confinement at the hands of the Americans. He has the skills to be the world's most fearsome assassin and now the CIA needs him. They offer him freedom, money, and a neutral passport in exchange for one small service: to go to Beijing and kill the Soviet Union's commissioner to China.<br><br> It's almost certainly a suicide mission, but Hel accepts. Now he must survive chaos, violence, suspicion, and betrayal while trying to achieve his ultimate goal of <i>satori</i>-the possibility of true understanding and harmony with the world.";
