window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Revolutionary singer, songwriter, producer, bandleader, and funk icon George Clinton travels the rich cosmos of his musical history. As the second most sampled artist in the world (right behind James Brown), Clinton examines his incongruous path from delivering milk to Sarah Vaughan on Avon Avenue in Newark, New Jersey, to embodying funk as we know it—from Motown to the Mothership. Clinton’s experiences as the mastermind behind his bands Parliament and Funkadelic and as the foremost authority on all things funk make for a distinctive, humorous, and thoughtful journey through modern music. Featuring exclusive live musical performances of favorites from Clinton’s catalogue, including “Atomic Dog”, “Flash Light”, and “Give Up the Funk”, <i>...And Your Ass Will Follow</i> invites listeners to strap in as funk’s greatest recounts the highs and highlights of his wild career, carving his own path, and soaking up all the universe has to offer along the way. All aboard the Mothership.</p>";
