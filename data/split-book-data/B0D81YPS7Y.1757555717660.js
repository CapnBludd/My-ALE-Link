Just as his grandfather did fifty years earlier, Van will meet and challenge the threat of an ancient empire that spans deserts, stars, and time. This enemy will force Van's hand as he confronts a question at the heart of who he is—what does it mean to be alive, and who controls your life?</p> <p>But there's more than just war and crime. There might be a wedding, there will be cheese, and Funboy has a growing career as a television personality in the Midwest, but only if he can wear a tuxedo, of course.</p> <p>Join Van and the crew as they find that friendship never dies, and neither does greed—at least, not around the Guild.</p>";
