window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this stunning best seller praised as \"our era's <i>Handmaid's Tale</i>\", a fierce new power has emerged - and only women have it (<i>Washington Post</i>).</p> <p>In <i>The Power</i>, the world is a recognizable place: There's a rich Nigerian boy who lounges around the family pool; a foster kid whose religious parents hide their true nature; an ambitious American politician; a tough London girl from a tricky family.</p> <p>But then a vital new force takes root and flourishes, causing their lives to converge with devastating effect. Teenage girls now have immense physical power: They can cause agonizing pain and even death. And, with this small twist of nature, the world drastically resets. From award-winning author Naomi Alderman, <i>The Power</i> is speculative fiction at its most ambitious and provocative, at once taking us on a thrilling journey to an alternate reality, and exposing our own world in bold and surprising ways.</p>";
