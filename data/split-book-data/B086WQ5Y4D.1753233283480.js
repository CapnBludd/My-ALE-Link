window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Go to war or go to jail.</b> </p> <p>For small-time street hustler Cam Alvarez, the choice is simple. He has no family, no friends, no place in the world...nothing to lose. When his latest con results in the death of a cartel hitman, Cam opts to join the Marines and leave Earth to fight a vicious alien enemy.</p> <p>Drafted into the Marine Drop-Troopers, Cam discovers there’s one thing he’s even better at than running street-con games, and that’s killing the enemy. Wrapped in an armored battlesuit, Cam finds purpose amidst the horror and destruction of the war, and the opportunity for a new sort of friends and family...if he can break the habits of a life spent alone, trusting no one.</p> <p>And, if he can survive....</p> <p><b>Rick Partlow returns with another kickass military sci-fi epic. It's perfect for fans of Jay Allan, Jasper T. Scott, and Scott Bartlett.</b></p>";
