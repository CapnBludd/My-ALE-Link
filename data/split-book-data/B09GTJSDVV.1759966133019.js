All his life, there was no mistake that a little side-stepping couldn’t fix.</p> <p>Until Laz wakes up one day in a cloning facility on a seemingly abandoned Earth.</p> <p>Laz finds himself surrounded by hundreds of other clones, all dead, and quickly realizes that he too must be a clone of his original self. Laz has no idea what happened to the world he remembers as vibrant and bustling only yesterday, and he struggles to survive in the barren wasteland he’s now trapped in. But the question that haunts him isn’t why was he created, but instead, who woke him up…and <i>why?</i></p> <p>There’s only a single bright spot in Laz’s new life: One other clone appears to still be alive, although she remains asleep. Deep down, Laz believes that this girl holds the key to the mysteries plaguing him, but if he wakes her up, she’ll be trapped in this hellscape with him.</p> <p>This is one problem that Laz can’t just side-step his way out of.</p>";
