window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations. Yet he toils willingly, trusting that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children.</p> <p>But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and lush wilds spread across the planet. Darrow—and Reds like him—are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class.</p> <p>Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity’s overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society’s ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.</p> <p>Adapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!</p> <p>Performed by Stewart Crank, John Kielty, Richard Rohan, Stephanie Németh-Parker, Jenna Sharpe, Kay Eluvian, Jon Vertullo, Ian Russell, Andrew James Spooner, Alejandro Ruiz, Andrew Colford, Bradley Foster Smith, Christopher Williams, Chris Stinson, Christopher Walker, Colleen Delany, Elizabeth Jernigan, Eric Messner, Ian Putnam, James Konicek, Joe Mallon, Joel David Santner, Julie-Ann Elliott, Karen Novak, Ken Jackson, Lucy Symons, Marni Penning, Martin Dickinson, Matthew Bassett, Matthew Pauli, Matthew Schleigh, Michael Glenn, Michael John Casey, Nanette Savard, Nazia Chaudhry, Nora Achrati, Shanta Parasuraman, Stephone Walker, Dylan Lynch, Yasmin Tuazon and Zeke Alton.</p>";
