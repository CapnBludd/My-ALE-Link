window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book number 19 in the multiple <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Ring of Fire series. </p> <p>After carving a free state for itself in war-torn 17th-century Europe, citizens of the modern town of Grantville, West Virginia, must contend with France's infamous Cardinal Richilieu, who is determined to keep his grip on power no matter what history says. </p> <p>France, 1636... </p> <p>It has been 20 years since King Louis took Ana Maria Mauricia, daughter of Spain's King Philip III, as his wife, and their union has not yet produced an heir. Under the guidance of his chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, a plan is developed to remedy that situation. Once she is with child, Queen Anne goes into seclusion to guard her health and protect her from those who would prefer that the child is never born - France's foreign enemies as well as schemers such as Monsieur Gaston d'Orleans, the king's younger brother and heir. When the Crown's opponents make their move, factions inside and outside France must choose sides and help determine the future and fate of the kingdom. </p>";
