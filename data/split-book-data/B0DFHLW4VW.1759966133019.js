In the expanse of his memory, Perry finds an ancient ship, and an even older war—and neither of those things have truly gone away.</p> <p>Faced with power and responsibility unlike anything he can imagine, Van Tudor is about to learn a fact that few people have ever known: The universe looks different when you're wearing a Master's badge. And those who don't have one just might want you dead.</p>";
