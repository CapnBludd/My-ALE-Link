window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Knowledge is power. That would be the motto of Lander University, had it not been snatched up and used to death by others long before the school was founded. For while Lander offers a full range of courses to nearly all students, it also offers a small number of specialty classes to a very select few. Lander is home to the Hero Certification Program, a curriculum designed to develop student with superhuman capabilities, commonly known as Supers, into official Heroes.</p> <p>Five of this yearâ€™s freshmen are extra special. They have a secret aside from their abilities, one that they must guard from even their classmates. Because for every one person in the world with abilities they can control, there are three who lack such skill. These lesser super beings, Powereds as they are called, have always been treated as burdens and second-class citizens. Though there has been ample research in the area, no one has ever succeeded in turning a Powered into a regular human, let alone a Super.</p> <p>That is, until now....</p> <p>Performed by Jonathan Lee Taylor, Darius Johnson, Alejandro Ruiz, Rana Kay, Megan Poppy, JJ Johnson, Zeke Alton, Kay Eluvian, Michael John Casey, James Konicek, Lolita Horne, Matthew Schleigh, Yasmin Tuazon, Rayner Gabriel, John Kielty, Tanja Milojevic, Matthew Bassett, Scott McCormick, Steven Carpenter, Colleen Delany, Natalie Van Sistine, Lydia Kraniotis, Emlyn McFarland, Henry Kramer, Chris Stinson, Anthony Palmini, Joel David Santner, Robb Moreira, Patrick Bussink, Mort Shelby, Holly Adams, Torian Brackett, Jessica Lauren Ball, Rose Supan, Carolyn Kashner, Nora Achrati, Marni Penning, Ken Jackson, Niusha Nawab, Nazia Chaudhry, David Zitney, Shanta Parasuraman, and Nanette Savard.</p>";
