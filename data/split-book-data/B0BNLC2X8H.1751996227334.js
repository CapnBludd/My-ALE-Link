window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the greatest novelist of the Victorian era comes a ghostly short story, now reimagined in 3D sound.</p> <p>Put your headphones on and settle in to this Audible Original adaptation of Charles Dickens’ <i>The Signalman</i>, narrated by Academy-Award winning director Sam Mendes (<i>Skyfall</i>, <i>1917</i>, <i>Empire of Light</i>).</p> <p>A lone narrator meets a railway worker who is confined to a cold, gloomy station in a deep cutting near a tunnel entrance. This worker is a signalman, and it is his responsibility to give the green light for trains to pass through the area. These are slow, monotonous days. The signalman’s life is not marked by much, until the nightmares begin.</p> <p>Three times in a row, a ghost mysteriously appears before the signalman – and with each apparition, a tragic accident unfolds on the rail tracks.</p> <p>Although our narrator doubts the man at first, events soon make him a believer too...</p> <p>Follow along as the mystery is revealed in spatial audio with Dolby Atmos, bringing the haunting tale closer to you than ever before.</p> <p>Now available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
