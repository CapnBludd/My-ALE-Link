window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A queen, a castle, a dark and ageless threat - all await Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes in this chilling new adventure.</b></p> <p>The queen is Marie of Roumania: the doubly royal granddaughter to Victoria, empress of the British Empire, and Alexander II, tsar of Russia. A famous beauty who was married at 17 into Roumania's young dynasty, Marie had beguiled the Paris Peace Conference into returning her adopted country's long-lost provinces, single-handedly transforming Roumania from a backwater into a force.</p> <p>The castle is Bran: a tall, quirky, ancient structure perched on high rocks overlooking the border between Roumania and its newly regained territory of Transylvania. The castle was a gift to Queen Marie, a thanks from her people, and she loves it as she loves her own children.</p> <p>The threat is...now, that is less clear. Shadowy figures, vague whispers, the fears of girls, dangers that may only be accidents. But this is a land of long memory and hidden corners, a land that had known Vlad the Impaler, a land from whose churchyards the shades creep.</p> <p>When Queen Marie calls, Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes are as dubious as they are reluctant. But a young girl is involved, and a beautiful queen. Surely it won't take long to shine light on this unlikely case of what would seem to be strigoi? Or, as they are known in the West...vampires.</p>";
