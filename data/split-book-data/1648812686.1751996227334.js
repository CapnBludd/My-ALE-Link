window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Chicago, 1932. Mick Oberon may look like just another private detective, but beneath the fedora and the overcoat, he's got pointy ears and he's packing a wand. </b></p> <p>Oberon's used to solving supernatural crimes, but the latest one's extra weird. A mobster's daughter was kidnapped sixteen years ago, replaced with a changeling, and Mick's been hired to find the real child. The trail's gone cold, but what there is leads Sideways, to the world of the Fae, where the Seelie Court rules. And Mick's not really welcome in the Seelie Court any more. He'll have to wade through Fae politics and mob power struggles to find the kidnapper – and of course it's the last person he expected.</p> <p>Performed by Eric Messner, Ren Kasey, Terence Aselford, David Coyne, Nora Achrati, David Jourdan, Kimberly Gilbert, Lily Beacon, Bob Payne, Andy Brownstein, Bradley Smith, Colleen Delany, Michael John Casey, Andy Clemence, Richard Cutting, Christopher Graybill, Nick DePinto, Matthew Keenan, Nanette Savard, Elliot Dash, Tim Carlin, Scott McCormick, Jeff Allin, Steve Wannall, Dylan Lynch, Casie Platt, Tara Giordano, Mort Shelby.</p>";
