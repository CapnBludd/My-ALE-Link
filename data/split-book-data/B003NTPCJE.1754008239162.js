window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They first appear as a series of dots on astronomical plates, heading from Saturn directly toward Earth. Since the ringed planet carries no life, scientists deduce the mysterious ship to be a visitor from another star. The world's frantic efforts to signal the aliens go unanswered.

Now the conquerors are descending on the American heartland, demanding servile surrender - or death for all humans.</p>";
