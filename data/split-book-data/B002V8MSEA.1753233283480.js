window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Retired and in a happy relationship, Kirk believes his adventuring days are over. But as he returns to Earth for the first time since his apparent \"death\" upon the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i>, events elsewhere in the galaxy set in motion a mystery that may provide Kirk with his greatest challenge yet. The <i>Enterprise-E</i>, under the command of Jean-Luc Picard, is exploring an unstable region of space on a mission of vital concern to Starfleet when they discover the last thing they ever expected to find: a battle-scarred vessel that is instantly recognizable to every member of Picard's crew. Five years after being presumed lost, the Starship <i>Voyager</i> has come home! The commander of the <i>Voyager</i>, Tom Paris, explains that Captain Kathryn Janeway and half the original crew is dead, but if that is true, who is the mysterious woman who has kidnapped Kirk back on Earth, demanding that he assist her against a threat to the entire Federation? All is not as it seems, and soon Kirk is forced to confront the consequences of actions taken 30 years before, as well as his own inner doubts. </p>";
