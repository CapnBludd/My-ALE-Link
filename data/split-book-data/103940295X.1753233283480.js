window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>After the recent near-destruction of the USS</b><b><i> Hamilton</i></b><b>, Captain Galvin Quintos has been lying low, getting the USS</b><b><i> Jefferson </i></b><b>ready for service.</b></p> <p>In the midst of refurbishing the vessel, he gets a call for help from his former XO, new starship captain Gail Pristy. The Varapin have lured the Ninth Fleet into a devious trap, and it’s not long before Quintos has his orders to hurry to the rescue. But the Varapin have a colossal new warship - one that puts anything the US Space-Navy has to shame. Even after Quintos assembles a crew, he’ll still need to pull a few rabbits, along with a few Symbio Poths, out of a hat to have any chance of surviving the coming battle. And Quintos’ one last hope - reuniting with a past enemy - may prove as dangerous as fighting the Varapin themselves.</p>";
