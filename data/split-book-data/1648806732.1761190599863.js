Now the clones rule Earth, but a new enemy has emerged — and set off civil war....</p> <p>Formerly trained to fight for the U.A., clone Marine Wayson Harris had led the Enlisted Man’s Empire invasion of Earth and wrested control away from the old regime. He’s now ready to do what it takes to ensure the new balance of power isn’t jeopardized.</p> <p>When a trio of religious fanatics from Mars attempts to attack Harris, he fears there is more unrest among the colony’s residents. Hoping to stave off an uprising, he leads a troop of Marines to Mars. But once there, they learn the situation is much graver than they first feared.</p> <p>The red planet’s refugees have decided the clones are their number one enemy, and measures to eradicate them are underway. And when Harris is kidnapped and drugged, he discovers something disturbing about himself.</p> <p>He can be reprogrammed....</p> <p>Performed by Ken Jackson, Terence Aselford, Joel David Santner, Tim Pabon, Casey Jones, Elizabeth Jernigan, Nick DePinto, Michael John Casey, David Harris, Danny Gavigan, Richard Cutting, James Lewis, Steven Carpenter, Evan Casey, Elliot Dash, Scott McCormick, Tracy Lynn Olivera, Gregory Gorton, David Coyne, Christopher Scheeren, Nora Achrati, Thomas Keegan, Mort Shelby, Michael Glenn, Richard Rohan, Kimberly Gilbert.</p>";
