One brutal murder.</p> <p>We find the doll shattered on the floor, its broken pieces scattered like a warning. That's when everything starts to fall apart.</p> <p>Now the power is out. A storm has trapped us here. And someone is dead.</p> <p>We've only been married three months. And our first holiday as man and wife is spending ten days in a secluded Scottish manor with my husband's old friends. I've never met them before.</p> <p>From the moment I arrive, I feel like an outsider.</p> <p>And it's not just his friends. Things haven't been normal since the first day, when someone moved the dolls.</p> <p>I told them not to — never move the dolls before the tenth day of Navaratri, the Hindu Festival of Dolls. They're not toys. They're part of a sacred tradition.</p> <p>But no one listened. Even Dhruv — my husband — told me to stop being silly.</p> <p>I know they're hiding something. I can't trust any of them — not even the man I married.</p> <p>Now one of us is dead. One of us is a killer. Am I going to make it out of here alive?</p>";
