window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A bad best man’s speech can ruin a wedding. Why do we plan every detail of a perfect day and then give the groom’s idiot best friend five minutes of total power?</p> <p>Enter Nate (Glen Powell), a speechwriter-for-hire who helps people write incredible best man speeches. To keep the best man from embarrassing himself (and the newlyweds), Nate uses his list of don’ts: Don’t mention the exes, don’t be rated R, and don’t bum everyone out. Nate’s system never fails. That is, until he meets Dan (Nicholas Braun), the dopey, hopelessly awkward best man for the biggest social media influencer’s wedding of the year. On top of that, Nate just got engaged to the woman of his dreams, and now he has to find his own best man–forcing him to confront a brutal friendship breakup with his former best friend.</p> <p>As Nate helps Dan with his speech, he explores the insane and often idiotic world of male friendship and must come up with an answer to the one question most men never think about: Why is their best friend their best friend?</p> <p>Featuring an all-star cast including Ashley Park, D’Arcy Carden, Lance Bass, Zach Braff, and more, <i>The Best Man’s Ghostwriter</i> is a laugh-out-loud, heartfelt audio show written and directed by comedian and former real-life best man’s ghostwriter, Matthew Starr.</p>";
