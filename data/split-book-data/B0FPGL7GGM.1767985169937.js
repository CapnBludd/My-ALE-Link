window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An army of monsters walks among us. A war wages between petty gods. The end of the world draws ever closer. And worst of all, Jack can't find anyone else to help cover the night shift. Coming as a surprise to absolutely no one, Jack finds himself once again neck-deep in the middle of another deadly nightmare-come-true. And this time around, it's going to be a lot harder to tell who's a friend, who's an enemy... and who's even human. In the third installment of the Gas Station Tetralogy, Jack’s world will change forever. Questions will be answered, and answers will be questioned. Friends become enemies. Strangers become enemies. Frenemies become enemies. (You know what? Jack is going to have a lot of new enemies.) Prepare yourself. Things are about to get weird.</p>";
