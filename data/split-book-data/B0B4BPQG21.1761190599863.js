But when he discovers a deadly centipede placed in his hotel room, the vacation is over.</p> <p>On this island, all suspicious activity leads inexorably to Dr. Julius No, a reclusive megalomaniac with steel pincers for hands. To find out what the good doctor is hiding, 007 must enlist the aid of local fisherman Quarrel and alluring beachcomber Honeychile Rider.</p> <p>Together they will combat a local legend the natives call “the Dragon,” before Bond alone must face the most punishing test of all: an obstacle course―designed by the sadistic Dr. No himself―that measures the limits of the human body’s capacity for agony.</p>";
