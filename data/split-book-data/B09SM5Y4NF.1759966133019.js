Still, it was safer than the bounty hunter career that had cost Gregory Roarke his left arm six years ago. And thanks to his Kadolian partner Selene’s ultrasensitive sense of smell, they occasionally discovered a medically promising seed or spore they could sell under the table. It was a quiet life, uneventful and mostly legal. <br> <br> Until Roarke was approached by two men with a proposal: track down a mysterious woman named Tera and, through her, locate a secret project called Icarus. <br> <br> The challenge was intriguing. The unlimited budget was tempting. But Roarke had a more personal reason to accept the job. <br> <br> The chance for long-delayed payback.</p>";
