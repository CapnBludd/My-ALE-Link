window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Searching for a new home....</b> </p> <p>The <i>Galahad</i>, a faster-than-light spacecraft, carries 50 scientists and engineers on a mission to prepare Kepler 452b, Earth's nearest habitable neighbor at 1400 light years away. With Earth no longer habitable and the Mars colony slowly failing, they are humanity's best hope. </p> <p>After 10 years in a failed cryogenic bed - body asleep, mind awake - William Chanokh's torture comes to an end as the fog clears, the hatch opens, and his friend and fellow hacker, Tom, greets him...by stabbing a screwdriver into his heart. This is the first time William dies. </p> <p>It is not the last. </p> <p>When he wakes from death, William discovers that all but one crew member - Capria Dixon - is either dead at Tom's hands, or has escaped to the surface of Kepler 452b. This dire situation is made worse when Tom attacks again - and is killed. Driven mad by a rare reaction to extended cryo-sleep, Tom hacked the <i>Galahad</i>'s navigation system and locked the ship on a faster-than-light journey through the universe, destination: nowhere. Ever. </p> <p>Mysteriously immortal, William is taken on a journey with no end, where he encounters solitary desperation, strange and violent lifeforms, a forbidden love, and the nature of reality itself. </p> <p><b>...he discovers the infinite.</b> </p> <p><b>Jeremy Robinson, the master of fast-paced and highly original stories seamlessly blending elements of horror, science fiction, and thrillers, tackles his most ambitious subject matter to date: reality itself. An amalgam of the works of J.J. Abrams and Ridley Scott, <i>Infinite </i>is a bold science fiction novel exploring the vastness of space and a man's desire to exist, find love, and alter the course of his life.</b> </p>";
