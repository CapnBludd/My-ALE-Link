window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p></p> <p>The English Manor House has long been a world apart where landed gentry freely indulge in their passions, not only for outdoor sports, but the indoor variety as well. Lascivious activities are enthusiastically, pursued by lusty men and sensual women behind large and imposing stone walls, hidden from prying eyes. In that bygone era – the 1920s, relations between men and women were not as progressive as they are today. Hopefully, modern listeners won’t be too terribly offended by the less-than-sensitive treatment young Philippa Gresham-Cantwell is made to endure at the hands of her randy in-laws.</p>";
