window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The final year at Lander has finally arrived for the Melbrook students and their peers, and with it comes a whole new set of challenges. Still reeling from the events of their junior year, the remaining students will have to push past their pain—and so much more—if they hope to be one of the ten to claim the title of Hero upon graduation.</p> <p>Constant tests and trials await the senior students. Beyond simulated missions and classes, they’ll also have to buckle down to learn about agents, prospective teams, internships, and other seemingly endless elements of being a Hero.</p> <p>For some, however, the classroom is only one aspect of the trouble that lies ahead. Long-buried secrets have been unearthed; old mysteries are finally unraveling; and what lies at the center of it all has the potential to rock the realm of Heroes to its very foundation.</p> <p>Performed by Jonathan Lee Taylor, Rana Kay, Robb Moreira, Darius Johnson, Zeke Alton, James Konicek, Megan Poppy, Wyn Delano, Steven Carpenter, Ken Jackson, Tanja Milojevic, Matthew Schleigh, Joel David Santner, Nanette Savard, Matthew Bassett, James J.
