window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Earth, AD 2519. The clone soldiers of the Enlisted Man’s Empire, formerly members of the Unified Authority’s powerful military, believe they have finally secured their freedom. They may not live to learn how wrong they are....</p> <p>After launching an unsuccessful invasion of Washington, DC, the Unified Authority is on the verge of defeat. Then the clones intercept a message detailing the U.A.’s last ditch plan for survival: a super weapon, a virus designed to attack the clones’ internal architecture. Only one clone was created without the fatal flaw — Wayson Harris, an outlaw model with independent thoughts and an addiction to violence.</p> <p>As his empire collapses and his comrades die around him, Harris begins a one-man war against the government that created, betrayed, and ultimately destroyed his brothers. Fighting the war becomes more difficult, however, as the rush from the constant combat has reached its peak — and is driving Harris slowly insane....</p> <p>Performed by Ken Jackson, Elliot Dash, David Jourdan, Joel David Santner, Joe Brack, Tracy Olivera, Michael Glenn, Patrick Bussink, Yasmin Tuazon, David Coyne, Steve Wannall, Christopher Scheeren, David Harris, Tim Getman, Scott McCormick, Evan Casey, Richard Rohan, Gregory Gorton, Elizabeth Jernigan, Matthew Basset, Christopher Walker, James Lewis, James Konicek, Todd Scofield, Colleen Delany.</p>";
