It will revive your faith in Broadway itself.” —USA Today</p> <p>“This truly twisted yarn is THE SURPRISINGLY FEEL-GOOD MUSICAL OF THE SEASON! It should have a hell of an afterlife.” —The New York Times</p> <p>Directed By David Cromer</p> <p>Based on a “that can’t actually be true” story, Dead Outlaw is the darkly hilarious and wildly inventive new musical about Elmer McCurdy, an early 20th-century outlaw who became a traveling corpse and accidental celebrity. After a botched train robbery and an untimely death, Elmer’s body embarks on a decades-long postmortem adventure—through carnivals, roadside attractions, wax museums, and even a Hollywood film set. Dead Outlaw dives into the absurdity of fame, the inevitability of failure, and the meaning—or utter meaninglessness—of legacy.</p> <p>With music and lyrics by Tony Award winner David Yazbek (The Band’s Visit) and Erik Della Penna, and a book by Tony Award winner Itamar Moses (The Band’s Visit), and directed by Tony Award winner David Cromer (The Band’s Visit)- Dead Outlaw marks Audible’s first-ever commissioned musical.</p> <p>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
