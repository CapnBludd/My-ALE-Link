Now, another girl comes back…</i></p> <p>When five-year-old Elsie Button was snatched from a garden in a sleepy town on the Welsh island of Anglesey, and a local man later confessed, it sent shockwaves through the tight-knit community. How could one of their own do such a thing? Especially when his own little girl was the same age – and the victim's best friend.</p> <p>Kathryn and her family left under the cloak of darkness one night, unable to bear the shame, and the anger of their neighbours. She hardly remembers that time. Now, she suffers the consequences of living under an assumed name, always looking over her shoulder. Her dad has not spoken a word to her since he went to prison. She is haunted by the question: why did he kill Elsie?</p> <p>When another child is taken from the same garden, twenty-five years to the day of Elsie's murder, Kathryn is determined that this time she'll be on the right side. She'll join the search and atone for her father's deed, and maybe, just maybe, get the answers she wants. But she's not prepared for the long memory of the locals, nor the risks of going back. Not everyone on the island wants the truth to come out, and they'll go to extreme lengths to stop that from happening.</p> <p><b>A gripping must-listen psychological thriller from the #1 bestselling author Jenny Blackhurst. Unmissable for fans of K. L. Slater, C. L. Taylor and S. E. Lynes.</b></p>";
