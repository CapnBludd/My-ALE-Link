window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Get this 32-hour box set of pure kickass military sci-fi - a thrill ride combining space opera and first contact! </b> </p> <p>Terminal Lance Lucky Lee Savage likes his life. Sure, doing PT hungover is a pain, but no one can dodge responsibility like he can - or sweet-talk the cooks into giving out double rations. </p> <p>But when Lucky’s ambushed behind enemy lines and left for dead, along with a handful of privates so boot they actually respect his authority, he has to step up, manage the ambitions of his foul-mouthed AI, and figure out what’s tearing a hole in the fabric of space-time before everything goes haywire. </p> <p>Lucky wouldn’t bet on the universe. One thing he will bet on: Somewhere, somehow, somebody is going to pay for all this. And he is going to be right there to pull the trigger. </p> <p><b>If you like </b><b><i>Aliens </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Firefly</i></b><b>, you'll love this funny, gritty, and endlessly entertaining series!</b> </p> <p>Books included in this box set: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Lucky Universe</i></li> <li><i>Lucky Legacy</i></li> <li><i>Lucky Empire</i></li> <li><i>Lucky Forever</i></li> <li><i>Lucky Invasion</i></li> </ul>";
