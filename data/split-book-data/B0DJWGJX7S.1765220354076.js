And apparently it’s Lee Harden’s job to find them, get them out, and–most importantly–retrieve their research.</p> <p>But if Lee has any hope of getting past the huge population of primals in the area, he’s going to have to enlist the help of someone he thought he’d seen the last of: a human-primal hybrid named Kat.</p> <p>On paper, it's a quick, in-and-out mission. And Lee, Abe, Marie, Sam, and Jones are not keen on getting involved. The whole thing stinks of intrigue, and frankly, none of them are interested in going into an unknown situation with a hybrid they don’t particularly trust.</p> <p>Unfortunately, they aren’t given an option. Someone in the Interim American Government is pulling some heavy-duty strings to get them involved in this operation.</p> <p>When Lee’s team–plus Kat–land in Virginia, they’re quickly swept up in a conflict where their allies might want them dead, and their enemies might be their only chance at survival.</p> <p>Isolated and cut off from support, Lee and his team race against a ticking clock to uncover the truth about the scientists, what’s so important about their research, and who–if anyone–they can trust.</p> <p>As the bodies stack up, and a complex web of lies and state secrets begins to unravel, Lee must decide how much the truth is worth to him.</p> <p>Because it might just cost him everything.</p> <p>____________</p> <p>* <b><i>Coyote Song</i></b><b> is a stand-alone novel based on the universe built within the Remaining series and the Lee Harden series.
