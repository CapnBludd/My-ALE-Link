window.bookSummaryJSON = "The deadly and tyrannical Emperor Tiberius, former captain of the <i>I.S.S. Enterprise</i>, has always been rankled by his failure to seize the tantalizing advances of the First Generation. In the peaceful universe of the United Federation of Planets, Tiberius seeks a new ally - the honorable, idealistic Starfleet Captain James T. Kirk. <p>Kirk is many things Tiberius is not. But he is also a man deeply in love with his wife - and Teilani is dying. To save her life, Kirk will compromise his ideals and enter into his most dangerous alliance yet. Kirk guides Tiberius to a long-abandoned First Federation base, where he expects to find a source of power so great it will enable Tiberius to destroy Captain Jean-Luc Picard's <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i>, and conquer the mirror universe - as well as our own.</p> <p>At the heart of their quest, something else is waiting: an object from a technologically advanced civilization revealed to Kirk by mysterious aliens who have influenced life within the galaxy over eons of time - a message from the Preservers.</p>";
