window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Earth, AD 2516. The Unified Authority spread human colonies across the six arms of the Milky Way galaxy, ruling with an iron fist and a powerful military made up almost entirely of clones. Then the alien Avatari invaded - and when the fighting was over, the U.A. retained control of only two planets: Earth and New Copenhagen....</p> <p>Like the thousands of clones before him, Lieutenant Wayson Harris was born and bred as the ultimate soldier. But he is unique, possessing independence of thought - and an addiction to the rage of battle. So when he and other clone survivors of the New Copenhagen debacle are sent to cool their heels in an isolated \"relocation camp,\" Harris feels on edge. And with good reason.</p> <p>The military brass are looking for someone to blame for the decimation of the U.A. Republic. And who better to scapegoat than those who were born to be sacrificed?</p> <p>But Lieutenant Harris is about to respectfully disagree with all the firepower he can muster....</p> <p>Performed by Ken Jackson, Thomas Keegan, Colleen Delany, David Coyne, Jeff Baker, Gary Telles, Tim Getman, Patrick Bussink, Nick DePinto, Daniel Sonntag, Christopher Scheeren, Joel David Santner, Tim Pabon, Scott McCormick, Eric Messner, Richard Rohan, Michael Glenn, Tim Carlin, Johann Dettweiler, Lilly David, Terence Aselford, Elliot Dash.</p>";
