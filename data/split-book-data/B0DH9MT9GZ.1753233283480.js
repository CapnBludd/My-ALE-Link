window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fresh off the success of her groundbreaking first play, <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>, Lorraine Hansberry's <i>The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window</i> tells the tragicomic story of a young bohemian couple in New York's Greenwich Village, struggling to do what's right in a world that rewards everything that's wrong. Sidney is a dreamer who wants his own Walden Pond; Iris is a budding actress whose own backstory is a performance. They're caught in a moment where, \"the world is about to crack right down the middle,\" as the play deftly tackles racism, sexism, antisemitism, homophobia, liberal complacency, and more. A 2023 Tony Award Nominee for Best Revival, Rachel Brosnahan and Oscar Isaac lead a stellar cast, bringing wit and humor to characters and issues that are as relevant today as they were in the turbulent 1960s.</p>";
