Infinite possibilities, creating infinite realities. Long have I watched Marc Spector cheat death in the name of the Egyptian god Khonshu. But…what if Moon Knight was subsumed by a Venom from another universe?</i><br> <br> Marc Spector is used to voices in his head. He’s used to waking up disoriented, unsure what his alters, Jake and Steven, might have been up to. He’s used to having an Egyptian god command him as Moon Knight, his avatar of justice and revenge. What he’s not used to: staring into the face of a literal, out-of-body doppelganger.<br> <br> Another Marc, crash-landed from an alternate reality, begging for help? Yeah, that is a new one, even for him.<br> <br> But before he can really process anything beyond Khonshu’s incessant alarm bells, it becomes clear this <i>other Marc</i> didn’t travel solo. Some kind of alien — a symbiote named Venom— casts off its current host and begins to merge with Marc, forcing Khonshu away from his chosen champion and claiming Moon Knight for its own. The formerly stark white suit that struck fear into the hearts of criminals now looms as a jet-black shadow over friends and foes alike. Marc’s lethal prowess fueled by Venom’s penchant for violence carves a trail of chaos as they comb through the vigilante’s torturous past.<br> <br> Yet a sliver of hope remains: Finally free of Venom’s control, the <i>other</i> Jake and Steven re-gain consciousness to find themselves in a strange reality, without their Marc, but with a strange bird-like <i>god </i>insisting that “they will do.” Desperate, lost, and running out of time, the pair make a deal: become Khonshu’s new avatar to track Venom’s path of destruction, save this universe, and just maybe figure out a way back to their own.</p>";
