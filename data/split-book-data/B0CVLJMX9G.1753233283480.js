With one of their own gone and another under serious investigation, none of the former Powereds knows how many days remain for them in the Hero Certification Program.</p> <p>The time they do have will be filled with more trials and classes, honing their skills as they work toward the increasingly difficult goal of becoming Heroes. Ample new challenges await them, and not all of them can be met on the safety of Lander’s campus.
