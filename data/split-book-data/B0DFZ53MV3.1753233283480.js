window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>London. A city drowning in fog. Amid that fog, a man with no name dies above a strange junkshop. Threads of mist and intrigue weave around a court case with no resolution, linking great country houses with the lowest slum in the city, mingling the high-born with a boy who sweeps the filthy streets, enshrouding devious plots and sudden murder, bringing together two extraordinary women – Lady Dedlock and Esther Summerson - who seem to have nothing whatsoever in common but who will find themselves inextricably linked.</p> <p>Audible's trilogy of Dickens dramatizations, executive produced by Sam Mendes, and with a new original score by Dan Gillespie-Sells, concludes with the most dramatic and atmospheric yet, starring Thandiwe Newton (<i>Westworld</i>), Ambika Mod (<i>One Day</i>), Mackenzie Crook (<i>The Office</i>) and Mark Strong (<i>Kingsman</i>).</p> <p><b>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</b></p>";
