window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Extra! Extra! Read all about the town that traveled through time! </b></p> <p>The most popular alternate-history series of all continues. When a cosmic disturbance hurls your town from 20th-century West Virginia back to 17th-century Europe - and into the middle of the Thirty Years' War - you have to adapt to survive. And the natives of that time period, faced with American technology and politics, need to be equally adaptable. Here's a generous helping of more stories of Grantville, the American town lost in time, and its impact on the people and societies of a tumultuous age. </p> <p>With stories by: Eric Flint, Griffin Barber, Robert Waters, Kerryn Offord, Alistair Kimble, and more!</p>";
