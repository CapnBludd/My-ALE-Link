window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An epic first-contact story on a galactic scale.</b></p> <p>Humans have reached the stars. There is no evidence any other species survived its own sentience long enough to do the same. Until now, when the Magellanix deep-space scout <i>Accipiter</i> discovers the Artifact, a million-year-old alien construct resting in a dormant volcano on a faraway world.</p> <p>Now, TransGalactic has sent the <i>Carpathia</i> to steal it. Two ships, two rival corporations, and a race only one of them can win.</p> <p>The stakes are greater than they seem. The Artifact is more than just a technological marvel. It holds the key to humanity's survival, and—perhaps—an understanding of our place in the universe at last.</p>";
